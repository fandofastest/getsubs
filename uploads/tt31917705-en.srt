1
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,500
Although inspired by the life
of Bruno Sulak,

2
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:20,708
this film is fiction.

3
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:24,125
Characters, situations, places
and certain events

4
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:27,000
might be modified or reinvented

5
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,791
to express the author's artistic vision.

6
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,250
Ladies and gentlemen, nobody move.
This is a robbery.

7
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,875
No one will get hurt if you do as I say.

8
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,416
Tie your hands.

9
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,083
- I have two kids.
- You can tell that to the cops.

10
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,500
The tape.

11
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,583
Open the cash drawers slowly.

12
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:27,958
Fill up the bag.

13
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,333
Fill up the bag that has been provided.

14
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:34,083
The checkout at the far end, get the bills
together and give them to number 2.

15
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:38,208
Morning, ma'am. I'm gonna take a lollipop.

16
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,791
Here. Tie your hands, sit down.

17
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,083
And remember, this money is not yours.

18
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,416
- Hurry up. Do as he says.
- Thank you, Nicole.

19
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,333
Relax, it's not your money.

20
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:56,333
- Checks as well?
- Yes, checks and bills, thank you.

21
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,208
Good. There.

22
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,166
It's easy, right? Thank you.
Have a lovely day.

23
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,708
- Here.
- Thank you.

24
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,416
Thank you, ma'am.

25
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,875
Can you hold this? It's too sweet.

26
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,166
Have a pleasant day.
Apologies for the inconvenience.

27
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,250
And I'll see you soon.

28
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:12,625
Hey!

29
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,000
Careful. Watch the road, Annie.

30
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:36,291
- So this isn't your bag?
- No.

31
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,666
And what's in it is not yours either?

32
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,000
No, it's not.

33
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,082
What are you doing here, then?

34
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:47,166
- I don't know.
- Well, you're innocent.

35
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,957
Damn. That was very nearly
a miscarriage of justice.

36
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,957
I was this close to sending him to prison.

37
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,332
Excuse me. Sorry.
I'm sorry. You can go.

38
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,291
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,250
Wait, Tonio, tell me one thing.

40
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,541
How many times have I arrested you?

41
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:07,000
- Give me a number.
- I don't know.

42
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,666
Six... Maybe seven times.

43
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,583
Seventeen times.

44
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,208
Sit down.

45
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,582
Come on, the old lady recognized you.

46
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,041
Boss, there's been a robbery
at the Orange Continent.

47
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:25,250
- The Orange Continent?
- The old Unico.

48
00:05:25,332 --> 00:05:27,750
- Shit. Any casualties?
- None.

49
00:05:27,832 --> 00:05:29,291
Well, that's something.

50
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,625
How much?

51
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:32,916
Around 200k. This week's takings.

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,250
We've identified one of the guys
from a photo.

53
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:39,875
Sulak Bruno, born on November 6th, '55,
in Sidi Bel Abbès, Algeria.

54
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:43,041
Legionnaire in the 2nd REP,
deserted 18 months ago.

55
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,457
Does he have a record?

56
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:48,125
He did four months for theft
when he was 18.

57
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:50,125
Small stuff.

58
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,582
Since he deserted,
he's upgraded his business,

59
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,457
he's suspected in a dozen robberies.

60
00:05:55,707 --> 00:05:59,041
Always supermarkets.
Avignon, Albi, Beaune.

61
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,208
Always the same crew. Two of them,
plus one who waits in the car.

62
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,458
- Who identified him?
- Two employees.

63
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,958
They were in the robbery.

64
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,666
- They're here.
- Could they be accomplices?

65
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,791
Honestly, everything's possible,
but I doubt it.

66
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:18,666
- Bring them in. I'll talk to them.
- Okay.

67
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,832
- No, leave the photo here.
- Okay.

68
00:06:22,832 --> 00:06:24,375
Tonio, my boy.

69
00:06:24,707 --> 00:06:28,000
This is your lucky day.
Get out of here, I'm tired of you.

70
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:31,541
Just go before I change my mind.

71
00:06:35,332 --> 00:06:37,666
The black and white doesn't help.

72
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,375
You can't see the color of his eyes.

73
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:44,375
- It's a bit stiff.
- But mugshots, you know...

74
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:46,000
No one looks great in profile.

75
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,875
He's better looking in person.

76
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:52,000
Eyes like that are really unforgettable.

77
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,375
And his smile. A big smile.

78
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,207
- Lovely.
- A handsome boy.

79
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,833
And polite.

80
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,041
Good-looking.

81
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,833
Really good-looking.

82
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,916
Wait, ladies,

83
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,500
we're talking about a robber.
Not some pretty boy in a club.

84
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,791
Your little angel has stolen 20 million.

85
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes, well, I...

86
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:19,875
- And the other?
- The other?

87
00:07:19,957 --> 00:07:22,000
- What other?
- The other guy.

88
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,707
I couldn't really see.

89
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:29,125
- I didn't pay attention, sorry.
- Me neither.

90
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:31,000
Thank you, ladies.

91
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,916
Who is this clown?

92
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,250
- One.
- What?

93
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,833
Forget it.

94
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,500
I don't believe you, you won't do it.

95
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,333
- Two.
- Stop it.

96
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:10,041
It's stupid,
we don't even know how deep it is.

97
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,125
Bruno.

98
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,750
- I'm serious. Very serious.
- You're very serious?

99
00:08:16,832 --> 00:08:19,332
If you do this, I won't talk to you
for the rest of the day.

100
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,916
- The rest of the day? That's a long time.
- Very long.

101
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,457
- Three.
- Bruno, stop.

102
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,416
I'm serious. I'm scared.

103
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:34,000
I love you too.

104
00:08:34,082 --> 00:08:35,500
No!

105
00:08:44,415 --> 00:08:45,958
Yeah, right.

106
00:08:47,415 --> 00:08:49,040
Very funny.

107
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,540
Come up now.

108
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,290
Bruno!

109
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,958
Bruno!

110
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,125
Bruno!

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,916
You're a dick!

112
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,833
Fuck!

113
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:33,958
You're a dick.

114
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,708
I... You scared me.

115
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,625
You're as crazy as I am.

116
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,290
You didn't know that?

117
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,708
Do you know what I love the most?

118
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,000
Besides me?

119
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,166
Besides you.

120
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,000
The wind on the skin.

121
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,416
The wind that caresses.

122
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,915
And you?

123
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,915
- Besides you?
- Yes.

124
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,750
The speed.

125
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:46,958
Do you know what I wanted to do
when I was young?

126
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,415
- No.
- A lot of things.

127
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,290
- What's stopping you?
- Nothing.

128
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,125
I'll do them all one day.

129
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,083
- Do you know what I like the most?
- No.

130
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:05,375
When the sky and the sea meet
and you can't see the horizon.

131
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,625
We'll go live by the sea.

132
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,625
And we'll have a baby.

133
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,291
What?

134
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,665
- Hi. I'm Bruno.
- Annie, nice to meet you.

135
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,083
Nice to meet you.

136
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,958
We can share a bottle.

137
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,916
Sounds good. Who's that?

138
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,750
Marika's here.

139
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,416
Look at my princess.

140
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,250
- I thought you were coming tonight.
- Hi!

141
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,833
Nope.

142
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,625
- How are you?
- My princess.

143
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,750
Come have a drink.

144
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,166
This is beautiful.
I'm happy to see you.

145
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:27,208
- What do you think of the view?
- It's not too bad.

146
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,416
Over there is Le Château de ma mère.

147
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,625
And over there, La Gloire de mon père.

148
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,000
And he just jumped on him.

149
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,125
On his shoulders.

150
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,415
And he just bit his neck.

151
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,208
Seriously. His tendons were...

152
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,415
- That's not what happened.
- Yes, it is.

153
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
You can't say that, Bruno.

154
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,875
It's a matter of common sense.

155
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,165
You have no common sense.
You can't say that politics is useless.

156
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,750
Politics only helps the rich to stay rich,

157
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,040
and the poor have to shut up.

158
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,125
You're exhausting,
you don't believe in anything.

159
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,375
I believe in freedom.

160
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,083
And Chirac, Marchais
and Mitterrand won't give it to us.

161
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,000
I disagree.

162
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:11,708
- Who's taking the second share?
- You.

163
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,458
But my share is your share.

164
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,708
Everybody did the job,
everybody gets paid.

165
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,833
I don't care, I don't want it.

166
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,208
Give me the checks.

167
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,833
Can you believe it?

168
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:31,708
We've given a lot of groceries
to a lot of good people.

169
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,790
But we should tell these good people,

170
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,875
because instead of thanking you,
they want to see you in jail.

171
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,625
- Robin Hood.
- We haven't done anything wrong.

172
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,958
Except stealing from
bigger thieves than us.

173
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,125
Don't worry,
the big cats never go to jail.

174
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,833
- Communist!
- It's not about that,

175
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,665
I just want to blow everything up.

176
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:52,540
Terrorist, then.

177
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,208
- Are you messing with me?
- No.

178
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:00,416
What?

179
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,250
Nothing.

180
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,041
You're handsome.

181
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:27,291
Ladies and gentlemen, nobody move.
This is a robbery.

182
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,375
Do as I say and everything will be fine.

183
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,375
Hurry up!

184
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,208
SUPERMARKET COOP

185
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,500
Nobody move, this is a robbery!

186
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,458
Do as I say, and no one will get hurt.

187
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,250
Open the cash drawers.

188
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,000
Empty them in this bag. Hello, ma'am.

189
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,333
The 500 bills together,
the 100 bills together.

190
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,333
- Come on, baby.
- You have to put it behind.

191
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,625
Look.

192
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,166
- Amazing.
- You got me closer.

193
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,750
- That's our ball.
- That's two points.

194
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,000
Should we start again?

195
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,666
- Hola, cabrones!
- Patrick.

196
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,375
Behind the mountain.

197
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,416
You're not ready to play now.

198
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,166
- I'm exhausted.
- It's nice to see you.

199
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,500
What do we have to drink?

200
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,958
Some friends of mine had a vineyard,
amazing wines.

201
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,540
They could mess with your head.

202
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,833
But apparently,
it was back in the 12th, 13th century.

203
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,665
- Wines that drive you mad?
- Or blind.

204
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,708
That's totally bullshit.

205
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,083
- It doesn't happen with all the grapes.
- You said that.

206
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:54,333
- Okay, I'm going back up.
- What?

207
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:56,165
- Yeah.
- Are you coming with me?

208
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,165
- Are you coming?
- I'll be right there.

209
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,666
- Be careful.
- Don't worry, I worked in a restaurant.

210
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,040
Put the knife down.

211
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:07,125
- You're trying to calm me down.
- Calm down.

212
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:11,458
You're trying to calm me down, I know you.

213
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,290
I know you.

214
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,333
This feels nice.

215
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:19,790
Patrick, listen to me if you want to come.

216
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,290
Why not that one? It's closer.

217
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,040
No. We've already hit
all the supermarkets in the area.

218
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:27,875
No, we haven't done that one,
outside Rodez.

219
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,041
Which one is it? Continent, Mammouth?

220
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,625
My dear Continent lover, it's a Mammouth.

221
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:37,708
Patrick, you go in after me,
you hold the cashiers at bay.

222
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,750
- And where am I, Bruno?
- You, my love,

223
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:44,083
you're in the parking lot,
ready, engine going.

224
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,833
Okay. What kind of car do we have?

225
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,041
- A Renault 30.
- No, I said I wanted a BMW.

226
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,375
- It's fine.
- They're heavy, not reliable.

227
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,208
We tried to get another one.

228
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,291
I want a BMW, guys.

229
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,750
It's about the driver, not the car.

230
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,916
- Is everybody ready?
- Ready.

231
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,500
- No worries.
- We'll go at six o'clock tomorrow morning.

232
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,958
- Don't party too hard.
- You too, Pat.

233
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:11,708
I'll check the plan one more time.

234
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,750
Okay, let's go. Good night, everyone.

235
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,625
Just in case...

236
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,791
Give the bag to the next cashier.

237
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,833
Come on, it'll be over soon.

238
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,833
Fill it.

239
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:51,166
Next register, thank you.
Please stay calm.

240
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,250
- What are you doing?
- Fill up the bag.

241
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,416
- You coon, you're not Al Capone.
- I'll show you.

242
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,166
- What's up?
- Patrick, cable ties, go on.

243
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:03,166
- What do I do?
- Cable ties!

244
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,375
Everybody stay calm.
Nobody moves, hands on the counter.

245
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,208
I don't want to die, I have a little girl.

246
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,708
Shut up. On the counter.

247
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,875
- Load it. Shut up.
- You'll pay for this.

248
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,750
- Load it.
- Drago?

249
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:16,750
Fill up the bag!

250
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,833
Hands on the counter!

251
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,166
Listen to me, fuck!

252
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,125
I said shut up!

253
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,875
- What's wrong? You got this?
- We're fine.

254
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,875
- Tell me.
- We're fine.

255
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,958
You're not going to die, calm down.
Nothing will happen. Relax!

256
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,625
Get your hands off me. Relax.

257
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,708
Shut up, stop moving!

258
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,541
Stop moving!

259
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,708
- Are you insane?
- Move.

260
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,166
- Listen to me! Calm down.
- I don't want to die.

261
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,500
- What is he doing?
- Move.

262
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,208
Breathe, relax.

263
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,791
- I can't breathe.
- Stop.

264
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,916
I can't brea...

265
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,208
Look at me.

266
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,625
- Relax, Brigitte.
- Breathe.

267
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:07,166
- I can't! Help, I can't do it!
- Look at me, stay with me.

268
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,375
Let's bounce.

269
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,625
- What's going on?
- Shush.

270
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,333
What shush? Calm down, boy.

271
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,791
What? What's going on?

272
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,833
- Why did you do that?
- Did you kill someone?

273
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,666
Next time, I'll kill you.

274
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,333
- Is that a threat?
- Yes.

275
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,916
We're here for the money,
not to kill people.

276
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,916
- Are you threatening me?
- Yes.

277
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,541
I didn't kill anyone,
this thing just went off!

278
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,750
- Calm down.
- Shut up!

279
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,916
We're fine, nothing happened, calm down.

280
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,041
Don't do that ever again!

281
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,916
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

282
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,333
- What's the story?
- He recognized Sulak from the photo.

283
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,625
Take everything. The other side, too.

284
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,458
Hello. Tell me what happened.

285
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,833
She's the cashier who got attacked.

286
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,583
I'll go talk to her.

287
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,041
They came in, we got violently attacked.

288
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:44,541
They pointed their guns at us,
they were shouting.

289
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:48,250
- How many were they?
- Four or five.

290
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,833
- Can you describe them?
- Yes.

291
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,708
One big Black guy.

292
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:56,791
A beast with bloody eyes.

293
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,416
And a small hysterical white guy.

294
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,333
In my opinion... You know?
He was screaming, shouting, shooting.

295
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,375
And a blond guy with blue eyes,
in a complete panic too.

296
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,291
He was rude to everyone. Very rude.

297
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:14,250
- And then?
- I screamed, and they all left.

298
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,083
- And they took nothing?
- They took our takings.

299
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,541
I can humbly say that I saved lives.

300
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,750
That's great.

301
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:26,500
So? What do you think?

302
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,708
With dumbasses like him,
we will never catch Sulak.

303
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,458
For sure.

304
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:38,500
We're organizing having drinks tonight,
for your departure.

305
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,916
A farewell party? I don't like that.

306
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,166
Warm bubbly, cold appetizers.

307
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,791
Drunk officers trying
to hook up with the receptionist.

308
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,833
- Pathetic.
- It makes the guys happy.

309
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:52,708
It's not every day you get promoted
to Chief of Organized Crime.

310
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,375
We need to celebrate.

311
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,416
If you say so.

312
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,291
Ciao.

313
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,833
- What?
- Let's get out of here.

314
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:34,250
- Now?
- Pack your things.

315
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,625
Get dressed, pack a bag,
meet me downstairs.

316
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:43,625
Don't turn on the light.

317
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:51,000
Drago, Marika, let's get out of here.
Take the BMW, we'll see you in Paris.

318
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,125
Patrick! Wake up. We're leaving!

319
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
- What's happening?
- He thinks the cops are coming.

320
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,250
- Drago, move!
- Coming.

321
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,833
Shit.

322
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:44,583
It's crazy how you can feel
they're coming. How do you do that?

323
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:46,958
- Fuck!
- Did you see that?

324
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:51,541
- Are we going to Paris?
- Let's go, mi amor.

325
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,125
I told Drago. It's over, I'm out.

326
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:05,000
I've had enough of the police raids.

327
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:08,958
No more prison, no more lawyers,
no more packages. Enough.

328
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,875
I've had enough.
He promised he would stop.

329
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:14,375
- Drago never went to prison?
- No.

330
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:17,166
But it always ends up with prison.

331
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,583
Who ended up in jail?

332
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,375
My ex.

333
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:27,875
He died in there.

334
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:31,583
A settling of scores.

335
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:34,583
What are you thinking? Banks?

336
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,166
Banks are all connected
to local police stations.

337
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,291
Armed security, traceable bills.

338
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:40,583
Foreign exchange counters?

339
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:46,250
No. You know what's good?
Fancy jewelers.

340
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:49,250
Jewelry is nice, it's small, fancy.

341
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:52,458
I'm a thug's girl, that's it,
That's how it is, I can't change.

342
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:54,125
And you?

343
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:58,833
I'm not a thug's girl, I'm with an artist.

344
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:03,583
A poet, an outsider, a rebel.

345
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:06,833
Everything he does, he does well.
He tried rollerblading,

346
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:10,625
he was a natural. Jumps, tricks...

347
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,708
- Backflips.
- You're addicted.

348
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:14,416
We are addicted, yeah.

349
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,833
Drago drives me crazy too.

350
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:20,541
But I won't put mine on rollerblades.

351
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:28,083
What are we doing with a loser like him?
He's nothing but trouble.

352
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:31,208
You know, if it wasn't for the fact
he's your friend...

353
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,041
Yes, but he's my friend.

354
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,208
- Okay, but be careful.
- I'll talk to him.

355
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:37,166
- You know what?
- What?

356
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:39,250
If they go to jail...

357
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,375
- Let's end up together.
- Sure.

358
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:42,541
Deal!

359
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:48,833
I don't understand, why aren't we dancing?

360
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:51,000
- We're going.
- Let's go.

361
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:54,708
Let's go!

362
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,750
Hey. Tell me, Bruno.

363
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:39,041
Your bling, who will you flog it to?

364
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:41,291
- My bling?
- Yeah.

365
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:44,958
We'll flog it back to them,
or the insurance companies.

366
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:46,958
That's a good plan.

367
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,458
That's smart, it could work.

368
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:52,625
What's this idiot doing now?

369
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:57,708
He's messing with a guy
he shouldn't mess with.

370
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,125
- Do you know him?
- Yeah,

371
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:00,625
Steve. He's from Yugoslavia.

372
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:03,416
Go talk to him, he's gonna crush him.

373
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,000
- I want him to get crushed.
- Go.

374
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,750
Steve...

375
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:38,458
It's paradise here.

376
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:40,750
French cops are babies.

377
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:44,541
French prisons are better
than hotels in Yugoslavia.

378
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,208
It's paradise, I'm telling you.

379
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,041
- Are you working?
- Here and there.

380
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:51,750
I was Belmondo's bodyguard.

381
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:53,666
Belmondo? Seriously?

382
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,416
I even shot a movie with him.

383
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,458
Hear that? He knows Belmondo.

384
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:01,500
Belmondo, damn. That's awesome.

385
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,916
I'm sleeping where Belmondo...

386
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:09,375
Not sure you'd be into it,
but if you want to work with me,

387
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,708
I may have something in the works.

388
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,708
We'll see.

389
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:40,291
Hello, sir. Welcome.
What can I do for you?

390
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:42,250
I'd like to see your earrings.

391
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:43,333
Of course, follow me.

392
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:48,958
Is it for a special occasion?

393
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:52,291
- An anniversary?
- Wedding anniversary.

394
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:55,583
- Very well. Do you have a budget in mind?
- No, I thought...

395
00:29:55,666 --> 00:30:00,000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a robbery.
Everything will be fine.

396
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:02,958
I'll handle it. Your hands, please.

397
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:06,208
On the floor, sir. On the floor.

398
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:08,208
Your hands, please. Hands.

399
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,416
Go. Fifty seconds.

400
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:16,250
Stay calm. We're here for the jewelry.

401
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:17,541
Nobody will get hurt.

402
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:22,791
Stay calm, thank you.

403
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:25,375
No noise. It'll soon be over.

404
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:32,208
Thirty seconds.

405
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:39,708
Let's go!

406
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:43,458
Thank you for cooperating.
Have a lovely day.

407
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,833
It was a pleasure doing business with you.

408
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:48,083
- And have a nice weekend.
- Thanks.

409
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:56,375
Great job!

410
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,333
Let's go.

411
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:09,791
- Shit, there are two cars behind us.
- Relax.

412
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:15,541
- What are you doing?
- I'll handle it.

413
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,208
Move!

414
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:20,250
They think they own the place.
It's always the same.

415
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:21,916
Calm down, I'll take care of it.

416
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,583
- I'm calm, I just need to pick up my kids.
- Excuse me.

417
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:28,125
Move. You're blocking traffic, sir.

418
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:30,416
Stay calm.

419
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:35,125
- You can go, ma'am, move.
- Thank you, officer.

420
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:50,041
- I'm telling you, this bastard...
- Can I get a coffee?

421
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:53,166
- He attacked me.
- Shut up!

422
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,458
One at a time!

423
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:57,750
Want me to sit down?

424
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,958
Sit down!

425
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,625
I'll press charges.

426
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,750
What the hell?
We can hear you from over there.

427
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,791
I'm the victim,
but these assholes won't listen.

428
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:12,875
What did you say?

429
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:15,458
Assholes... What's going on?

430
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:19,708
He says his client didn't pay him.
They had a fight. Nothing new.

431
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,416
We found this on him.

432
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:27,916
Drugs, soliciting, assault, theft.

433
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,333
That's quite the list.

434
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:35,125
Get me out of here
and I'll give you a crew.

435
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:38,500
A crew? Who? What crew?

436
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:41,875
Yugoslavs. They're planning a robbery.
I know one of them.

437
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:45,208
But... Keep going, I'm interested.

438
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:47,041
Take these off me, then we'll talk.

439
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:49,250
- And my complaint?
- We'll write it down.

440
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,916
Take it. Come with me.

441
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,666
- And I want my money.
- Don't push it.

442
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:56,416
The Jaeger-LeCoultre I told you about.

443
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:01,333
A platinum model
with automatic perpetual movement.

444
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:03,416
Classic and modern.

445
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,833
It's very popular.

446
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:07,416
Do you like it?

447
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:13,791
- Is that a yes or a no?
- Yes, I said.

448
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:16,708
Could we...

449
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:19,708
- Can I put it on you?
- Of course.

450
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:28,125
- Isn't it a bit heavy?
- No, I don't think so.

451
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:33,125
- How much is it?
- This model is 63,000 francs.

452
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,333
I see. I better not lose it then.

453
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:41,375
Or have it stolen, because these days...

454
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:43,791
There are so many robberies, you know?

455
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:46,875
Listen...

456
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,125
I'll take it.

457
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:52,166
- Very good. Will you keep it on?
- Yes, please.

458
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,416
I'll let you talk to my colleague
about the payment.

459
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,125
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

460
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,500
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

461
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:11,958
Congratulations, it's a fine piece.

462
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:14,208
Thank you. Can I get a discount?

463
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:18,083
I don't think that's possible.

464
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,666
What if I pay cash?

465
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:28,541
In that case, I can give you 3% off.

466
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,208
Five.

467
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,750
Three point five.

468
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,875
Three point five...

469
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:59,625
I'll take it.

470
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,958
It's nice.

471
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:42,666
- What time is it?
- 7:00.

472
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,458
You always get up early.

473
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,125
Let me sleep.

474
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:56,333
- Croissants?
- Yes.

475
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:08,666
- My love?
- Yes, my love?

476
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,916
Can you get me tampons?

477
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,583
Of course, my love.

478
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:15,166
Thank you.

479
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:04,750
You don't know any of these guys, right?

480
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,916
- That's right.
- Sure.

481
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:16,166
- And you? Miss...
- Braumann, Sophie. No.

482
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:17,791
No, what?

483
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,125
No, I don't know them.

484
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,708
Sophie Braumann.

485
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:27,083
That's Alsatian, Braumann.

486
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:30,000
- My parents are from Bordeaux.
- Bordeaux?

487
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:31,875
That's a beautiful city.

488
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:34,916
The Saint-Jean neighborhood,
the Saint-André cathedral,

489
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,875
the Garonne, the canelé cakes.

490
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,041
- The wine, sometimes.
- Why the hell am I here?

491
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:42,916
What do you think?

492
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:46,833
I don't know this girl,
we hooked up last night.

493
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:48,500
If I had known...

494
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:50,916
It's dangerous to follow strangers.

495
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,083
Has your mother from Bordeaux
never told you that?

496
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,458
No, sir. She never told me that.

497
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:59,708
Okay.

498
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:02,958
Stop taking me for a fool, both of you.

499
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:04,875
Your little act is worn out.

500
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:09,791
You, honey,
I'll arrest you as an accessory.

501
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:12,291
Criminal conspiracy.

502
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:16,375
Fake ID, because they are fake IDs, right?

503
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:21,666
And possession of stolen goods,
or do you have a receipt for the necklace?

504
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,791
Accessory to what? Are you insane?

505
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,708
Leave her alone.

506
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:28,666
Do you know the women's wing
at La Santé prison?

507
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:33,083
It's no Club Med.
Especially for a pretty chick like you.

508
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:35,458
She's gonna make a lot of friends. A lot.

509
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:39,041
I didn't do anything,
I don't know this guy, we fucked once.

510
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:42,708
I hope he was good,
because you're gonna pay for it.

511
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,125
You're looking at five years in jail,
at least.

512
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:50,166
When you're out, you'll be broken.

513
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,083
Screwed.

514
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:55,208
You won't be able to work again,
I'll make sure of that.

515
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:58,125
You'll have to work the streets
to pay for your fix.

516
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,875
One morning,
you'll end up dead in a dumpster

517
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:03,583
behind a bar with a syringe in your arm.

518
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:05,208
I don't do drugs.

519
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:10,083
- Not yet, but it will happen.
- I didn't do anything.

520
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:13,291
- The court will decide.
- Enough!

521
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:15,416
Stop.

522
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:20,833
- Why do you care?
- Fine, you win.

523
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:22,958
Leave her alone, I'll talk.

524
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,583
There you go.

525
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:30,416
What do I get in return?

526
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,750
I'll give you all the robberies
if you leave her alone.

527
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:34,958
And your buddies?

528
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:37,916
What buddies?

529
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:43,583
- Pérez?
- Yes, boss?

530
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:47,291
- Come pick up the lady.
- Okay, boss. I'm on my way.

531
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:55,666
- Okay, come on.
- It's okay.

532
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,291
- Ouch.
- Come on.

533
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:00,250
Let's go!

534
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:13,791
- What you did is really shitty.
- I know.

535
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:16,125
I'm listening.

536
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:26,791
Finally, the Cora supermarket in Beaune,
was that you?

537
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:28,125
Yes.

538
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,833
Tell me more.

539
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:34,083
You won't arrest her, right?

540
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:36,250
I gave you my word.

541
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:38,916
- Yeah.
- I did.

542
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,875
I'll talk to the judge,
she'll get probation.

543
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,583
What about her fake IDs?

544
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:55,333
What do you want to know?

545
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:57,916
I went in, I robbed the place and I left.

546
00:41:58,375 --> 00:41:59,875
End of story.

547
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:03,125
- Alone?
- Yes.

548
00:42:03,583 --> 00:42:08,291
You say you robbed 19 supermarkets
in eight months. Impressive.

549
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:10,458
Always alone?

550
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:12,875
- Always alone.
- No, I don't buy that.

551
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:14,625
I'll tell you what I think.

552
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:18,291
You were with your buddy Drago,
and the girl was waiting in the car.

553
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:19,708
I don't know any Dragan.

554
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,166
Dragan? We busted your buddies.

555
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:27,166
Stop playing stupid, Bruno.

556
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:33,083
Come on, you have enough
to make the judge hard.

557
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:36,458
No, I'm very greedy,
that's my biggest flaw.

558
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:39,375
Well, it's mine too.

559
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,375
By the way, I need a favor.

560
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:43,791
What is it?

561
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:46,958
Can I keep my watch?

562
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:51,625
Your watch? What's so special
about your Kelton?

563
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:55,125
It's my dad's.
He gave it to me, it's precious to me.

564
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,958
The guards will take it from me
if I have it when I go in.

565
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:01,875
If it's a sentimental piece...

566
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:05,500
Thank you.

567
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:14,291
Let me say goodbye, please.

568
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,958
Be quick.

569
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:19,125
My love.

570
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:28,333
I love you.

571
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:32,000
- Come with me.
- I'll wait for you.

572
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:33,083
I love you.

573
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:36,083
Let's go, lovebirds.

574
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,833
Hi.

575
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:07,375
Hi.

576
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:14,541
What are you in for?

577
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:18,666
- Miscarriage of justice. You?
- Same.

578
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,375
I got 12 years for armed robbery.

579
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:38,083
You?

580
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:42,500
Awaiting trial.

581
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:48,041
I don't like the decor in here.

582
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:50,125
And the food looks disgusting.

583
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:51,791
I don't plan on staying.

584
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,916
Jean-Loup Lablache.

585
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:58,666
Bruno Sulak.

586
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,083
I know.

587
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:38,000
I don't think guards make enough money.

588
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:42,625
I could have something for you.

589
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:46,958
I could be interested.
But not here. Move.

590
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:48,458
You know where to find me.

591
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:26,041
My love, every day, with my words,

592
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:28,125
I caress your skin with the tip of my pen.

593
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,083
And your lips too.

594
00:47:31,791 --> 00:47:33,708
You know,

595
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:35,416
they want to make a beast out of me,

596
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,041
but no matter how much they try
with force or ruse,

597
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:40,708
I won't give in.

598
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:44,250
I want to live the life I want,
to stay the boy that is exhilarated,

599
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:47,166
like in the Reggiani song
that you like so much.

600
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:50,833
To stay the person who is amazed,
who dreams, who is waiting for you.

601
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:55,416
Life, my love, is not eternal.

602
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:01,916
I'm alive, alive when I write to you,

603
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,458
when I smell sometimes
the wind brushing my skin.

604
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:12,375
- How do we do it?
- Seventy-one.

605
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:13,708
Okay.

606
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:18,833
Hands on the table, old hand.

607
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:24,875
That's nice. I like it.

608
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:26,583
That's good stuff.

609
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:28,041
We can make a trident with this.

610
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:30,708
Tie them together, it'll hold.
It's strong.

611
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:33,416
- Will you get more?
- Of course I will.

612
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,958
You were right,

613
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:38,208
I like being an outsider,
different, like an artist.

614
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:40,791
In another life,
I could have been a painter or a writer.

615
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:42,958
But here, in prison,

616
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:44,583
there's no room for culture.

617
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:47,000
We are misunderstood, abandoned.

618
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:51,291
They won't get to me, I don't want
to fall into hatred and violence.

619
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:53,708
I'm stronger than this

620
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:56,791
and I'll be back more alive than ever.

621
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:01,916
I got 12 years in the slammer,
I've done nearly six now.

622
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:05,750
When I get out, I think...

623
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:08,166
I'll do simple things.

624
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,250
Chowing down by the sea.
Maybe in the mountains?

625
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,666
I'm not saying
that I'll shack up with a goat.

626
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,416
All clear.

627
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:57,541
Wait. It's holding. No, wait.

628
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:07,750
Come on.

629
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:09,833
Come on.

630
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:12,750
Come on.

631
00:51:16,208 --> 00:51:18,416
Let me... Shit.

632
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:40,000
Yes! That's it.

633
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:41,666
Let's go!

634
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,833
- Come on.
- Slowly.

635
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:19,333
Jump!

636
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:21,166
Come on, Jean-Loup!

637
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,375
Come on!

638
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,583
Come on, you're almost there.

639
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:29,250
Come on, you're almost there.

640
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:32,541
Give me your hand.
Come on, Jean-Loup.

641
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:36,000
You're almost there, Jean-Loup,
take my hand. Come on.

642
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:38,000
Good, hurry up.

643
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:45,375
- Come on, Jean-Loup!
- I won't make it.

644
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:47,375
- Come on!
- I won't make it, Bruno.

645
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:49,958
Jean-Loup! Jean-Loup!

646
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,541
Come on, damn it!

647
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:54,208
Get out of here, Bruno.

648
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:56,208
Get out of here, brother.

649
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:58,625
- Jean-Loup.
- Get out of here. I won't make it.

650
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:02,208
I'll come back for you.

651
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:14,000
Let's go!

652
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,666
Hello?

653
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,916
What do you mean, "he escaped?"

654
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:35,541
Okay.

655
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,375
No, no, no.

656
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:13,375
BRUNO SULAK DRAPED IN JEWELS

657
00:55:13,458 --> 00:55:15,625
POLICE ON SULAK'S HEELS

658
00:56:22,416 --> 00:56:24,666
SULAK, THE STAR

659
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:28,500
- He's making fools out of us.
- Why are you obsessed with him?

660
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:31,291
He's not
one of those trigger-happy idiots.

661
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:34,083
Cartier in Geneva, hit twice in two weeks.

662
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:38,375
Why does he do it? For the thrill!
He doesn't give a shit about the money.

663
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:40,916
How much did he make with the robberies?
One hundred, 150?

664
00:56:41,791 --> 00:56:45,208
He doesn't give a shit,
he just enjoys doing it.

665
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:48,666
We need to figure out why he does it,
then we'll be able to nail him.

666
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,375
- Move your asses.
- Okay.

667
00:56:50,458 --> 00:56:51,833
- Let's go!
- Let's go, guys.

668
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:53,958
Let's move.

669
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:59,458
- Shake down your snitches, but find him.
- Okay.

670
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,333
Anyone got a cigarette?

671
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:03,458
Do you mind?

672
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:06,583
A lighter?

673
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:32,333
Flat whites are not good for digestion.

674
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:33,750
What do you want?

675
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:35,625
Nothing. We thought we'd have
breakfast with you.

676
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:38,375
That's nice.
Were you in the neighborhood?

677
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:42,666
You know,
every cop in the country is after you.

678
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:46,625
We'll bust you,
in a week, a month, a year.

679
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:48,125
We'll see about that, pal.

680
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:49,458
Why did you come here?

681
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:53,125
To tell you to back off.
Don't you have other guys to catch?

682
00:57:55,916 --> 00:57:57,083
You're my favorite.

683
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:01,000
You're mine too.

684
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:05,958
Mine too.

685
00:58:06,333 --> 00:58:07,625
Thank you.

686
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:10,125
- Have a nice day.
- Anytime.

687
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:24,375
- This is a bit mad, right?
- A bit.

688
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:28,375
Let's go. Come on.

689
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,416
- Hello.
- Hello.

690
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,916
- Delostane.
- Go ahead.

691
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,041
Thank you.

692
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:11,875
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

693
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:15,791
Come in, step to the side.
Raise your arms.

694
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:21,375
Don't move.

695
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:22,833
Don't move.

696
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:24,333
On the ground.

697
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:29,666
- Open the door. Now.
- Open it.

698
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,416
- Open it!
- Don't move.

699
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:36,208
Go over to your friend,
lie down on the floor next to him.

700
00:59:36,916 --> 00:59:40,583
There. On the floor.

701
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:42,666
Hello, gentlemen.

702
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:46,750
First, let my friend in.

703
00:59:47,416 --> 00:59:49,875
- Done.
- Done?

704
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:51,083
Good job.

705
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:57,000
Cuff yourselves to the heater.

706
00:59:57,083 --> 00:59:59,250
I want the key to the cell.

707
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:02,333
Jean-Loup Lablache's.

708
01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:04,291
- Now.
- Thank you.

709
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,750
Michel, how was your daughter's recital?

710
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:10,416
Very good, thank you.

711
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,791
- Number 12.
- Number 12.

712
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,125
Sit down.

713
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:21,583
Cuff yourselves.

714
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:23,541
Gate!

715
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,875
Gate. Open the gate.

716
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,708
Good.

717
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:30,875
Gate.

718
01:00:45,666 --> 01:00:47,791
- What do you smoke?
- Gauloises.

719
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:50,291
- Not very strong.
- Unfiltered.

720
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:51,500
I thought it was stronger.

721
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:06,791
You're crazy.

722
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:10,375
- You're amazing.
- I told you I'd be back.

723
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:17,166
My friends are back.

724
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,708
- Bye, guys.
- Goodbye, gentlemen.

725
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:21,708
- It was a pleasure.
- Thank you.

726
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,250
- Bye.
- Have a nice day.

727
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:24,833
- See you.
- See you.

728
01:01:24,916 --> 01:01:26,750
Bastards.

729
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:29,208
Fuck!

730
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:32,958
Those guys have some balls.

731
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:37,708
Goodbye.

732
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,916
You guys are insane.

733
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:56,708
ID, cash, you've got everything.

734
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:59,333
And a ticket to Rio, through Lisbon.

735
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:01,166
Your name is Carlos.

736
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:04,125
Stop it, guys, I'm gonna cry!

737
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:06,750
- We'll be there soon.
- Thank you.

738
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:27,583
- Room 14, second floor.
- Thank you.

739
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:45,791
The door!

740
01:02:58,166 --> 01:02:59,791
I love you.

741
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:10,958
- What are you watching?
- A sad movie.

742
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:15,541
Hello? Can I speak to Franchet?
It's a private matter.

743
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:20,708
- Is it good?
- It's sad. I like it.

744
01:03:23,541 --> 01:03:26,875
Franchet, it's me.
I've got the rocks. Yes.

745
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:28,583
Twenty-five million.

746
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,625
In new francs, it's at least 100k.

747
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:33,875
Yes.

748
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:37,458
Tomorrow, midday. Pompidou Centre.

749
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:39,833
Okay, let's do that.

750
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:44,333
Come into my arms, my love.
It's too sad.

751
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:51,041
We got a lead. You'll like this.

752
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:54,541
Only one man. Where is the location
for the exchange?

753
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:56,958
- Franchet, the insurer.
- Yeah, at Beaubourg.

754
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,000
- Beaubourg.
- Pompidou Centre?

755
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:00,416
- When?
- Twelve o'clock.

756
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,166
- Twelve.
- Yeah.

757
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:13,958
- Circular motion, I said.
- Yes.

758
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,458
Quiet, please.

759
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:06,541
The court is now in session.

760
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:08,625
Will the defendant rise, please.

761
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:15,000
Your name is Sulak Bruno, born
November 6th, 1955, in Sidi Bel Abbès.

762
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:16,916
Yugoslavian nationality.

763
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,583
I'm not Yugoslavian,
I'm French, Your Honor.

764
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:23,000
My father is French from Poland,
like Michel Poniatowski,

765
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:25,708
and my mother is a pied-noir,
like Marthe Villalonga.

766
01:06:26,166 --> 01:06:29,416
Quiet, please. Good.

767
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:33,583
You are being charged for
fraudulently taking away cash

768
01:06:33,666 --> 01:06:37,625
to the detriment of supermarkets,
Mammouth, Atac and Rallye,

769
01:06:37,708 --> 01:06:39,375
between July 6th and 20th, 1983.

770
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:43,041
These acts were committed
as a part of a group,

771
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:45,708
and with use of a weapon
or threat thereof.

772
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:48,541
As well as criminal conspiracy.

773
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:52,916
Before we hear the testimony
of the lead investigator,

774
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,416
do you have anything to say?

775
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,958
I do, Your Honor.

776
01:06:57,041 --> 01:06:58,958
You may speak.

777
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:02,625
You know,
I was an excellent soldier. Excellent.

778
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:04,708
And I became an excellent outcast,

779
01:07:04,791 --> 01:07:08,291
just as I could I have become
an excellent cop or magistrate.

780
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:09,625
I surely doubt it.

781
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:14,125
What I would like for you to understand,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

782
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:18,416
and to you too,
Mr. Self-Righteous Prosecutor,

783
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,166
is that I don't recognize your court
or your justice.

784
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:24,291
You mean nothing to me,
I deny you the right to judge me.

785
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:25,666
The court takes note of this.

786
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:29,791
And neither Annie, Patrick nor Drago
were ever my accomplices.

787
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:32,333
That is not what the investigation
brought proof of.

788
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:36,208
Just like in astrology,
the police can say whatever they want.

789
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:38,708
Enough.

790
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:41,875
Sulak, we won't tolerate your impudence.

791
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:44,333
Impudence is all I have left.

792
01:07:44,416 --> 01:07:46,166
Fine, sit down.

793
01:07:51,625 --> 01:07:53,750
Defendant Drago, please rise.

794
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:56,833
He's not a proper Yugoslavian either.

795
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:05,458
Will the defendants please rise?

796
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:10,583
After due consideration,
the court and the jury

797
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:13,708
sentence each of you
to three years in prison.

798
01:08:15,041 --> 01:08:18,332
As for yourself, madam,
since there were no previous convictions,

799
01:08:18,416 --> 01:08:21,625
you are sentenced to 18 months in prison,

800
01:08:21,707 --> 01:08:25,957
which will be suspended
and served on probation.

801
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:28,750
You will be subjected to strict controls

802
01:08:28,832 --> 01:08:31,041
for a period of two years.

803
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:34,250
I'd like to say one more thing.

804
01:08:34,332 --> 01:08:38,707
Mr. Sulak, before you continue
your tour of France's court system

805
01:08:38,791 --> 01:08:41,125
for your many other offenses,

806
01:08:41,207 --> 01:08:44,166
please know that
if you don't change your attitude,

807
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:47,541
the sentences will be extremely serious.

808
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:49,541
Court is adjourned.

809
01:09:23,082 --> 01:09:24,207
Pick a card.

810
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,666
Do you really think
that you'd have been a good cop?

811
01:09:28,457 --> 01:09:30,041
Of course I do.

812
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:33,375
Finally, the card

813
01:09:33,457 --> 01:09:35,291
I was waiting two rounds for.

814
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:38,457
Why did you desert the legion?

815
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,082
Long story.

816
01:09:40,166 --> 01:09:42,625
To validate my freefall world record,

817
01:09:42,707 --> 01:09:44,582
I had to sign up for another five years.

818
01:09:44,666 --> 01:09:46,416
Five years.

819
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,041
Why didn't you do it?
You seemed happy.

820
01:09:49,125 --> 01:09:50,791
You don't understand.

821
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:54,500
No one tells me what to do.
No one. Ever.

822
01:09:56,708 --> 01:09:57,958
Pick a card.

823
01:09:58,416 --> 01:10:00,708
No one tells me what to do either.

824
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:02,458
No one. Ever.

825
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,666
That's stupid, we could have been pals.

826
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,125
I could have shown you the ropes.

827
01:10:10,208 --> 01:10:12,416
- The ropes?
- Of life.

828
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,958
- Life?
- Yes, your life is too restricted,

829
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:18,208
you're caught
between your bosses and felons.

830
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:20,166
I am free.

831
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:21,666
Really, you're free?

832
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:24,250
You're really free.

833
01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:28,500
Do you think
you're the only adventurer here?

834
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:32,333
We live the adventure too,
on the other side.

835
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:35,416
You, you're either on the run
or in the clink.

836
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,500
What kind of freedom is that?

837
01:10:39,791 --> 01:10:41,833
But you see, I chose this life.

838
01:10:42,708 --> 01:10:44,583
Even in jail, I'm freer than you.

839
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:48,166
Sure. Here we go, three sixes.

840
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:49,958
- Shit.
- Discard.

841
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:51,916
You're a lucky bastard, seriously.

842
01:11:05,083 --> 01:11:07,416
Why did you go back for Jean-Loup?

843
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:12,500
I promised him. And I'm a nice guy.

844
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:14,541
You are a nice guy.

845
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:16,833
- Of course.
- We both know that.

846
01:11:16,916 --> 01:11:19,583
The nicer you are,
the more people like you.

847
01:11:19,666 --> 01:11:21,708
The more they like you,
the more famous you get.

848
01:11:21,791 --> 01:11:23,666
And the more popular you get.

849
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:26,583
The more you annoy people.

850
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:29,958
Pick a card.

851
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,833
Excuse me.

852
01:11:42,583 --> 01:11:44,458
The gun.

853
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:46,000
In my bag.

854
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:49,541
Follow me.

855
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:54,041
Get in and shut up.

856
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:56,083
Close the door. I'm watching you.

857
01:11:58,791 --> 01:12:03,375
So you want to play, right?
Take that! Rummy.

858
01:12:04,583 --> 01:12:06,708
Didn't see that coming, right?

859
01:12:06,791 --> 01:12:09,333
Moréas, are you sleepy?

860
01:12:09,416 --> 01:12:11,666
You're a humble guy.

861
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:15,666
You want to play.
I don't want to play, I want to win.

862
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,750
Hello. Don't move, guys.

863
01:12:21,083 --> 01:12:24,041
- Let's go.
- No, thanks.

864
01:12:24,125 --> 01:12:25,375
I'd love that.

865
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:28,333
Guns in the bag, and the handcuff key.

866
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:29,666
Now.

867
01:12:29,791 --> 01:12:32,791
- Let me keep mine, it means a lot.
- In that case...

868
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,750
Are you sure?

869
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:41,583
I'm too old to be on the run.
Good luck.

870
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:47,041
- Bye.
- Bye.

871
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:49,458
Have a nice day.

872
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:54,875
Can you drop me off?

873
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:25,083
Spectacular escape

874
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:28,208
in the Corail train from Montpellier
to Lyon this afternoon.

875
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:31,666
A commando group made up
of several armed individuals

876
01:13:31,791 --> 01:13:35,875
managed to free the now
infamous Bruno Sulak,

877
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:38,083
as well as one of his accomplices,

878
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:41,791
while they were being transferred
to the Lyon penitentiary.

879
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:43,666
The fugitives are still at large,

880
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:47,333
despite the large contingent
of police officers on their trail.

881
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,500
Thank you for today.

882
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:52,750
Moving on, the economy.

883
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:56,916
EEC finance ministers are meeting
in Brussels

884
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,458
to raise by one point

885
01:13:58,541 --> 01:14:01,500
the interest rate of central banks,

886
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:05,333
which means that it will be
more difficult for households

887
01:14:05,416 --> 01:14:07,833
to get loans.

888
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,208
And they call us thieves.

889
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:25,500
We need to go. Far away.

890
01:14:26,875 --> 01:14:29,458
Let's go someplace warm, please.

891
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:33,750
In the sun.

892
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:35,791
To Los Angeles!

893
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,583
Chaplin's country.

894
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:43,208
- Jim Morrison's country.
- Los Angeles.

895
01:14:43,291 --> 01:14:44,625
Land of jewels.

896
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:54,541
Novica Zivkovic.

897
01:14:58,041 --> 01:14:59,791
That's my real name.

898
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:28,458
- Hello?
- Yes, pal. It's me, it's Bruno.

899
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:32,916
- Yes?
- I'm sorry about the other day,

900
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,250
we didn't have time for the rematch.

901
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:38,916
But we'll meet again very soon.

902
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,041
Sooner than you think.

903
01:15:41,125 --> 01:15:42,416
I'm not so sure.

904
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,541
Where are you? Are you in Paris?

905
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,833
We could have a drink one of these days.

906
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:52,041
Of course, you'll come alone.

907
01:15:52,125 --> 01:15:54,750
- Of course.
- Sure, why not? I'll think about it.

908
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:57,416
I have to go.
I can't say "See you soon," pal.

909
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:04,291
He's here, he's in Paris,
you need to find him!

910
01:16:24,791 --> 01:16:26,166
- Hello.
- Hello.

911
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,708
- I'm here to report.
- Sure.

912
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:40,000
POLICE STATION

913
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:43,375
- Hello.
- Hello.

914
01:16:43,458 --> 01:16:45,625
- I'm here to report.
- Thank you.

915
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:02,958
Annie Bragnier.

916
01:17:11,916 --> 01:17:15,083
- It's been two days. Move!
- Leave me alone.

917
01:17:15,166 --> 01:17:17,000
- No.
- Come on.

918
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:20,041
It'll put a smile on your face

919
01:17:20,125 --> 01:17:22,291
Come on, Annie

920
01:17:22,416 --> 01:17:24,708
I'll make you a wonderful meal.

921
01:17:24,833 --> 01:17:27,750
Oh, yes, my little Annie

922
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:40,875
- Hello.
- Annie Bragnier, reporting.

923
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:07,583
- What's up?
- It's been so long!

924
01:18:07,666 --> 01:18:08,958
Are you ready?

925
01:18:09,041 --> 01:18:12,500
- Ready? We're going on vacation.
- Really?

926
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:32,916
My love, what are you drinking?

927
01:18:34,791 --> 01:18:37,416
- How about some ice cream?
- Sure.

928
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,875
- Pistachio.
- Pistachio.

929
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:41,625
I'll get you one.

930
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:44,166
- Want some ice cream?
- No, I'm good.

931
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,208
Steve?

932
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:18,416
Are we on vacation?

933
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:40,666
What are you doing?

934
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:43,375
I'm leaving, I've had enough. Move.

935
01:19:45,125 --> 01:19:46,458
Why?

936
01:19:48,541 --> 01:19:49,791
Why?

937
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:53,541
I thought we were on vacation.

938
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:59,208
We can be on vacation and work.

939
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:00,583
I don't think it's funny.

940
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,125
It's gonna end badly, you know?

941
01:20:07,916 --> 01:20:09,416
What are you afraid of?

942
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:12,125
Nothing. I just don't want it
to end badly.

943
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:14,291
Actually, I am afraid for you and Steve.

944
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:16,625
See, you're afraid.
Do you want me to quit?

945
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:17,958
I never asked you to quit.

946
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:19,875
But I'll never ask you to keep doing it.

947
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:23,250
So what do you want, then?

948
01:20:23,333 --> 01:20:25,750
I just want a few days of peace with you.

949
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:28,791
You were gone to America for months.

950
01:20:28,875 --> 01:20:31,875
Just the two of us, for two days,
just two minutes, okay?

951
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:34,333
- Stop.
- When are you gonna stop?

952
01:20:36,625 --> 01:20:38,791
Don't you see? I won't be there.

953
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:41,333
I won't be there when you get arrested.

954
01:20:43,458 --> 01:20:46,125
Honestly, the Cartier in Cannes,
you must both be insane.

955
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:49,291
We won't get arrested. Annie, come on.

956
01:20:53,458 --> 01:20:55,083
Okay?

957
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,541
We won't get arrested.

958
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:10,708
Annie!

959
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:36,125
Forty million francs worth of jewels.

960
01:22:36,208 --> 01:22:39,500
That's the loot of the robbers
who attacked Cartier in Cannes yesterday.

961
01:22:39,583 --> 01:22:41,750
The two robbers were identified
by the police.

962
01:22:41,833 --> 01:22:45,666
The man is a Yugoslavian,
Bruno Sulak, "The Legionnaire",

963
01:22:46,083 --> 01:22:47,458
he already took part in

964
01:22:47,541 --> 01:22:50,916
- in most of the robberies.
- Annie! Bruno is on TV!

965
01:22:55,916 --> 01:23:00,541
Around 12.30 p.m.,
two people came in together.

966
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:02,625
About one minute apart.

967
01:23:02,708 --> 01:23:04,250
And they asked to see some pieces.

968
01:23:04,333 --> 01:23:06,708
Thanks to one of the employees' testimony,

969
01:23:06,791 --> 01:23:08,958
the robbers were easily identified.

970
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:12,208
They're two Yugoslavians,
Bruno Sulak and Radisa Jovanovic.

971
01:23:12,291 --> 01:23:15,958
Bruno Sulak, "The Legionnaire",
is well-known to the police.

972
01:23:17,041 --> 01:23:18,583
Bruno Sulak.

973
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:20,166
Bruno Sulak, the offender...

974
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:21,833
The uncatchable thief...

975
01:23:21,916 --> 01:23:23,500
The man who escaped twice...

976
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:26,791
The modern-day Arsène Lupin...

977
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:29,166
28 years old, hates violence.

978
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:33,583
The loot is said to be worth
dozens of billions...

979
01:23:33,666 --> 01:23:38,125
Sulak's heists have made him
the biggest public enemy number one.

980
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:40,250
A very gentle man.

981
01:23:40,333 --> 01:23:43,625
He's never, ever fired a gun.

982
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:46,791
That's a rule he always follows.

983
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:51,875
Yes? Boss! Sulak!

984
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:55,416
So, how about that drink?
Are you free today?

985
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,375
Noon at your café?

986
01:23:57,833 --> 01:24:00,000
But you come alone, right?
You promised.

987
01:24:00,083 --> 01:24:01,333
Of course, I promise.

988
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:05,125
If you ever find me in the street,
don't worry, I never carry a gun.

989
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:07,541
- You won't shoot me?
- I never carry a gun.

990
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:09,875
If we find you, you won't shoot at us?

991
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:11,291
No.

992
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:17,291
Then let me tell you something,
if I can't find you, I'll quit.

993
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:21,125
If you hear that I've quit,
it will be your fault.

994
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:23,666
- In the news?
- Exactly.

995
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:26,916
- Okay? See you soon.
- See you soon, pal.

996
01:25:13,916 --> 01:25:16,208
Police! Hands in the air! Don't move.

997
01:25:18,166 --> 01:25:19,833
Take off your helmet.

998
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:23,375
- Who the hell are you?
- Nobody.

999
01:25:23,458 --> 01:25:26,000
I was asked to deliver this bag
to some guy outside the café.

1000
01:25:26,083 --> 01:25:27,416
That's all. I'm a delivery guy.

1001
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:32,541
- Who asked you to deliver that?
- The baker.

1002
01:25:34,875 --> 01:25:36,125
Book this little clown.

1003
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:38,041
- Come on.
- I didn't do anything.

1004
01:25:39,416 --> 01:25:41,916
Call off the crew. Back to the station.

1005
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:03,458
Hands on the wheel.

1006
01:26:03,541 --> 01:26:06,208
Don't do anything stupid,
drive around the square. Come on.

1007
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:15,166
How are you doing?

1008
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:19,708
I'm good. How are you?

1009
01:26:21,666 --> 01:26:24,708
- Did you enjoy Cannes?
- Yes, it was ballsy.

1010
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:26,250
You're impressed, aren't you?

1011
01:26:27,666 --> 01:26:31,000
You gave me your word,
but you were far from being alone.

1012
01:26:31,083 --> 01:26:34,625
You know how the big bosses are.
I can't do what I want.

1013
01:26:34,708 --> 01:26:36,583
I told you on the train,
you've got no power.

1014
01:26:37,791 --> 01:26:39,208
Look in front of you.

1015
01:26:42,833 --> 01:26:44,083
I won.

1016
01:26:44,541 --> 01:26:46,958
You lost. I'm out of here.

1017
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:48,500
I quit.

1018
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,583
Look, I have more money than Borg.

1019
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:55,416
And I never played tennis.

1020
01:26:58,291 --> 01:27:02,666
You'll get bored on vacation.
I'll see you again.

1021
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:15,916
Okay, stop the car, I'm feeling nauseous.

1022
01:27:23,416 --> 01:27:24,375
Here.

1023
01:27:24,833 --> 01:27:26,291
Give this to Annie

1024
01:27:26,375 --> 01:27:29,041
and tell her to call this number
from a payphone.

1025
01:27:29,125 --> 01:27:30,750
Everything's inside. Tickets, cash.

1026
01:27:32,583 --> 01:27:33,708
No problem.

1027
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:36,916
- Do you have what I wanted?
- Yes.

1028
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:41,125
Here.

1029
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:44,083
Is it the Pole?

1030
01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:47,125
He's in jail.
It's another guy, from Marseille.

1031
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:48,208
DRIVING LICENSE

1032
01:27:50,458 --> 01:27:52,000
It's terrible work.

1033
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:53,625
And it's not cheap.

1034
01:27:53,708 --> 01:27:55,083
But you're famous.

1035
01:27:55,166 --> 01:27:57,500
People are scared.
They're asking for a lot of money.

1036
01:27:57,583 --> 01:27:59,333
Yes, I know.

1037
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:07,458
I'll call you when I'm in Rio.
Will you join us there?

1038
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:12,500
In Rio? I would absolutely love it.

1039
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:19,625
- Cheers, my friend.
- Cheers.

1040
01:28:27,166 --> 01:28:29,333
- Hello?
- My love.

1041
01:28:29,416 --> 01:28:32,041
My love, how are you? Where are you?

1042
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:34,083
Too far, I'm too far away from you.

1043
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,708
I'm about to cross the Italian border.

1044
01:28:37,791 --> 01:28:39,875
We're going somewhere warm, to Brazil.

1045
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:41,083
Brazil?

1046
01:28:41,166 --> 01:28:44,625
Yes, you and me.
We're going to spend all this money.

1047
01:28:44,708 --> 01:28:47,625
We're gonna go to the beach,
we'll make love, and laugh.

1048
01:28:47,708 --> 01:28:50,875
We'll eat good food, bask in the sun,
have a lot of babies.

1049
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:52,958
We need to stop hiding.

1050
01:28:53,041 --> 01:28:54,708
We'll stay stuck together forever.

1051
01:28:54,791 --> 01:28:56,083
ID check.

1052
01:28:56,166 --> 01:28:57,916
- I like that idea.
- Really?

1053
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,333
Yes.

1054
01:28:59,416 --> 01:29:00,791
- Will you join me?
- Yes.

1055
01:29:00,875 --> 01:29:02,250
- Are we leaving?
- Yes.

1056
01:29:02,833 --> 01:29:05,083
- See you tomorrow, my love.
- See you tomorrow.

1057
01:29:07,083 --> 01:29:08,625
- Hello.
- Buongiorno.

1058
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:11,791
Customs check.
Turn off the engine, please.

1059
01:29:13,166 --> 01:29:14,875
Do you have your ID?

1060
01:29:22,833 --> 01:29:24,125
Thank you.

1061
01:29:33,083 --> 01:29:36,000
Please step out of the vehicle
and follow me.

1062
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:46,458
FRENCH CUSTOMS

1063
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:51,458
I don't understand,
why a Belgian passport?

1064
01:29:51,791 --> 01:29:54,750
Why? The passport is Belgian
because my father is Belgian

1065
01:29:54,833 --> 01:29:56,625
and my mother is Italian.
It's simple.

1066
01:29:56,708 --> 01:30:00,041
- The dad's Belgian, the mom's...
- I get that.

1067
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:02,916
But I don't like your passport.

1068
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:05,250
So I'm waiting to hear back
from the embassy.

1069
01:30:05,333 --> 01:30:07,375
They will tell you the same thing,
Are you drunk?

1070
01:30:07,458 --> 01:30:08,583
I've wasted too much time.

1071
01:30:08,666 --> 01:30:11,083
I have to go to Italy,
I'm expected in Sicily.

1072
01:30:11,166 --> 01:30:13,333
I don't understand anything!

1073
01:30:13,416 --> 01:30:15,541
Please lower your voice.

1074
01:30:15,625 --> 01:30:17,208
Okay?

1075
01:30:19,708 --> 01:30:22,208
There's a woman somewhere else
waiting for me.

1076
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:25,125
- What is he saying?
- It's about a woman.

1077
01:30:25,208 --> 01:30:27,708
And I didn't tell my wife.

1078
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:29,250
Love.

1079
01:30:29,333 --> 01:30:32,875
Yes, it's adultery.
He's going to see a woman in Italy.

1080
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:34,666
This gentleman is married, is that it?

1081
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:37,791
But that doesn't explain the passport.

1082
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:38,916
I don't like it.

1083
01:30:39,041 --> 01:30:41,583
But there's nothing to understand.
I've wasted too much time.

1084
01:30:41,666 --> 01:30:42,875
Chatting here in this room.

1085
01:30:43,041 --> 01:30:46,833
Please. I can't wait any longer,
I have to go to Italy.

1086
01:30:46,916 --> 01:30:49,375
This woman is waiting for me. I can't...

1087
01:30:52,416 --> 01:30:53,583
Oh, Bruno.

1088
01:30:54,958 --> 01:30:57,375
Looking good.
Being blond suits you.

1089
01:30:57,458 --> 01:30:58,750
Thank you, gentlemen.

1090
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:01,583
Let's go.
It's over, let's go back to Paris.

1091
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:04,166
By train?

1092
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,333
Can I open the window?

1093
01:31:29,916 --> 01:31:31,125
Sure.

1094
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:04,000
Therefore, in the name
of the French people,

1095
01:32:04,916 --> 01:32:07,750
the court sentences you
to nine years in prison.

1096
01:32:08,875 --> 01:32:11,833
Which you will serve
in the Fleury-Mérogis Penitentiary.

1097
01:32:12,541 --> 01:32:14,250
The session is adjourned.

1098
01:32:42,041 --> 01:32:43,541
Let's go get Bruno.

1099
01:32:45,833 --> 01:32:48,625
I'll wait for him at 6:00 a.m.
at the heliport.

1100
01:32:49,291 --> 01:32:51,250
Yes, it's my only chance!

1101
01:32:51,958 --> 01:32:54,208
Come on, don't wait.

1102
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:06,708
You have to be drunk always.

1103
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:10,333
That's everything.
That's the only question.

1104
01:33:11,833 --> 01:33:15,083
For you not to feel the horrible
burden of time, breaking your shoulders,

1105
01:33:15,166 --> 01:33:19,125
and bending you down to earth,
you must be drunk without respite.

1106
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:20,625
But drunk on what?

1107
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:23,916
Wine, poetry,

1108
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:27,791
Or virtue. At your leisure.

1109
01:33:28,333 --> 01:33:32,083
And if, sometimes, on the steps of a
palace, on the green grass of a ditch,

1110
01:33:32,166 --> 01:33:35,416
in the dreary solitude of your room,
you wake up,

1111
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:38,875
with your drunkenness
diminished, disappeared,

1112
01:33:39,875 --> 01:33:43,208
ask the wind, the wave,
the star, the bird, the clock,

1113
01:33:43,291 --> 01:33:47,166
all that laughs, all that moans and all
that flees, all that sings, speaks,

1114
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:50,916
ask what time it is, and the wind,
the wave, the bird, the clock

1115
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,375
will answer you:
"'It's time to get drunk.'"

1116
01:33:54,291 --> 01:33:56,666
So as not to be time's martyred slaves,

1117
01:33:56,750 --> 01:33:59,125
get drunk, get drunk without respite".
- My love.

1118
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:04,833
"On wine, poetry, love,"

1119
01:34:05,375 --> 01:34:08,250
"or virtue, at your leisure."

1120
01:34:10,375 --> 01:34:12,875
I'm not even there to hold you in my arms.

1121
01:34:46,041 --> 01:34:47,458
Here.

1122
01:35:03,833 --> 01:35:06,458
- You're hungry.
- Jail food...

1123
01:35:07,583 --> 01:35:09,250
I can't even go to the cafeteria.

1124
01:35:09,708 --> 01:35:12,291
- Why?
- Beats me.

1125
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:16,166
They must be scared
I'd hide a saw in coffee grounds.

1126
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:20,958
I heard about Steve.

1127
01:35:27,875 --> 01:35:31,833
He was executed.
They didn't give him a chance.

1128
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:36,416
Abolition of the death penalty my ass.

1129
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:39,416
Do you agree with that?
You and your little colleagues?

1130
01:35:39,791 --> 01:35:41,375
It wasn't my team.

1131
01:35:41,833 --> 01:35:43,291
I handed in my resignation.

1132
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:53,083
- You're not a cop anymore?
- No.

1133
01:35:53,875 --> 01:35:57,250
- Because of that?
- Amongst other things.

1134
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,875
Since you're in jail,
I don't feel like chasing anyone else.

1135
01:36:02,958 --> 01:36:05,375
If you think that I'll stay locked up...

1136
01:36:10,416 --> 01:36:12,375
Admit it, you'll miss me.

1137
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:19,791
What are you gonna do now?

1138
01:36:23,041 --> 01:36:27,708
I'm taking some time
to travel, read, write.

1139
01:36:28,375 --> 01:36:32,916
To write detective novels,
that's a retired cop thing.

1140
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,500
Sure, why not?

1141
01:36:39,291 --> 01:36:41,041
Keep your head down.

1142
01:36:43,916 --> 01:36:45,166
Do your time.

1143
01:36:45,916 --> 01:36:48,250
You're still young,
you still have a lot to experience.

1144
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:51,666
Why are you telling me this?

1145
01:36:53,291 --> 01:36:55,583
They won't go easy on you
if you go too far.

1146
01:37:01,416 --> 01:37:04,583
You've given me an idea.
Maybe I'll write a book too.

1147
01:37:05,708 --> 01:37:08,083
- About what?
- Freedom.

1148
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:12,416
Love, the Mediterranean, life.
That's all I'll say or you'll steal it.

1149
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,291
Visit's over. Let's go, Sulak.

1150
01:37:23,083 --> 01:37:26,041
I don't even know your first name.

1151
01:37:29,833 --> 01:37:31,083
Georges.

1152
01:37:32,333 --> 01:37:33,958
It's Georges.

1153
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:38,416
- Bye, Georges.
- Bye, Bruno.

1154
01:37:40,875 --> 01:37:42,416
Take care of yourself.

1155
01:37:42,958 --> 01:37:44,500
Oh, you know me.

1156
01:37:44,583 --> 01:37:46,708
Okay, let's go.

1157
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:50,250
- Sorry, it's not easy here.
- Get up.

1158
01:37:50,791 --> 01:37:52,250
Come on.

1159
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:56,833
Will you come back?

1160
01:37:59,333 --> 01:38:01,375
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1161
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:02,708
Ciao.

1162
01:38:38,583 --> 01:38:40,625
We'll follow the plan.
I trust you.

1163
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:43,166
The walkie-talkie and the open door.

1164
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,291
I'm taking a lot of risks for Sulak.

1165
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:56,458
Wait for my last call
and my final instructions. Later.

1166
01:39:07,458 --> 01:39:10,833
Everything's ready, Bruno.
Follow the plan to the letter.

1167
01:39:10,916 --> 01:39:13,875
If there's a problem, get back
to your cell. Good luck.

1168
01:39:38,666 --> 01:39:40,500
I'm in the main corridor.

1169
01:39:40,583 --> 01:39:41,750
Okay, Bruno.

1170
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:04,416
- It's locked.
- It should be open.

1171
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:05,666
It's closed, what do I do?

1172
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:09,458
I don't understand. I left instructions.
I arranged it all.

1173
01:40:11,458 --> 01:40:13,125
Bruno? I can't hear you.

1174
01:40:13,208 --> 01:40:15,750
If it's not going to plan,
go back to your cell.

1175
01:40:34,708 --> 01:40:37,625
- What do you want?
- Americano, two sugars.

1176
01:40:41,666 --> 01:40:43,500
- Two sugars.
- Yes.

1177
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:07,416
Bruno?

1178
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,666
Get out.

1179
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:21,875
Get out of there.
What are you doing with this?

1180
01:42:15,875 --> 01:42:17,291
My love,

1181
01:42:18,041 --> 01:42:20,375
once again, I escaped in my dream

1182
01:42:20,458 --> 01:42:22,666
to fall asleep near your warm body.

1183
01:42:23,958 --> 01:42:25,625
A peaceful feeling.

1184
01:42:26,583 --> 01:42:29,000
Heavy body, light mind.

1185
01:42:29,166 --> 01:42:31,791
I fly, I float.

1186
01:42:31,875 --> 01:42:35,250
I can't feel gravity in the night
that surrounds me with your smell.

1187
01:42:35,833 --> 01:42:37,541
I'm not there anymore.

1188
01:42:37,625 --> 01:42:40,000
I'm disappearing and finally...

1189
01:42:40,541 --> 01:42:43,416
Finally, I find you forever.

1190
01:42:43,625 --> 01:42:45,416
Finally.

1191
01:43:01,458 --> 01:43:04,166
It has to end one day.

1192
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:07,541
Anyway, I would not have made
a very honorable old man.

1193
01:43:09,041 --> 01:43:11,875
But you know, it is my destiny.

1194
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,541
I know that.

1195
01:43:13,666 --> 01:43:15,166
Sometimes,

1196
01:43:15,291 --> 01:43:18,958
I think that this very last escape
will make me

1197
01:43:19,208 --> 01:43:20,666
a free man, forever.

1198
01:43:40,291 --> 01:43:44,625
FREEDOM
