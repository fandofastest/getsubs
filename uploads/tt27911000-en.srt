even in here two minutes.

01:03:21,777 --> 01:03:24,401

that I was invited to.

1115
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:42,944
Hey, big sis.

1116
01:03:43,026 --> 01:03:45,818
I've, uh, heard a lot about you.

1117
01:03:45,902 --> 01:03:47,401
It's nice to finally meet you.

1118

Hi.

1119
01:03:48,777 --> 01:03:52,151
Well, you've got a cool baby
bro here, and I treat him

1120
01:03:52,276 --> 01:03:53,193
like he's my own.

1121
01:03:53,276 --> 01:03:54,777

1124
01:03:58,401 --> 01:03:58,944
Oh, shit.

1125
01:03:59,026 --> 01:03:59,902

believe I'm sitting here

1130

with you guys.

1131
01:04:09,151 --> 01:04:10,878
I was literally just
telling your little brother.

1132
01:04:10,902 --> 01:04:11,777
I'm sorry.

1133
01:04:11,818 --> 01:04:12,693
I'm probably being
a little weird.

1134
01:04:12,777 --> 01:04:15,944
I'm just super
stoked to see you.

1135
01:04:16,026 --> 01:04:19,193
Mia has been following
our story very closely.

1136
01:04:19,276 --> 01:04:21,652
I am a true crime enthusiast,

1137
01:04:21,777 --> 01:04:24,026
and I've actually been following
your case in particular

1138
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:27,193
for years on my podcast,
and no rush or anything,

1139
01:04:27,276 --> 01:04:29,169
but I do know the five year
anniversary is coming up

1140
01:04:29,193 --> 01:04:31,401
and the fanbase is rabid.

1141
01:04:31,443 --> 01:04:34,902

kill for anything.

do on a daily basis,

1147
01:04:43,068 --> 01:04:44,318
Yeah.

How we're coping?

1149
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:54,026
Well, uh, I've been in and
out of a psychiatric hospital

1150
01:04:54,068 --> 01:04:55,276
for the past five years.

1151
01:04:55,401 --> 01:04:56,693
Oh.

1152
01:04:56,777 --> 01:05:00,526
I see images of my dead friends
and relatives on a daily basis,

1153
01:05:00,652 --> 01:05:03,818
images that wake me up screaming
in the middle of the night.

1154
01:05:03,902 --> 01:05:06,526
I have hideous scars
all over my body,

1155
01:05:06,568 --> 01:05:08,026
and every time I see them,

1156
01:05:08,068 --> 01:05:11,401
I think of how that sick
fuck who ruined our lives

1157
01:05:11,443 --> 01:05:12,568
is still out there.

1158
01:05:12,652 --> 01:05:14,692

I'm coping with everything?

At the mall, with Gabbie.

1168

sure it was really him?

1169

I'm not, I'm not sure
of anything anymore.

I don't know what's real or
what's in my fucking head.

01:05:51,193 --> 01:05:53,443
Well, what'd you see exactly?

1172
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:57,193
He was dressed as Santa Claus.

1173
01:05:58,777 --> 01:05:59,652

1174
01:05:59,777 --> 01:06:01,318
