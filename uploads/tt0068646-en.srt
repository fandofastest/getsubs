1
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,379
I believe in America.

2
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:22,424
America has made my fortune.

3
00:01:22,508 --> 00:01:26,637
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,558
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonor her family.

5
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:36,146
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,651
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,444
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:48,242
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:51,912
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:56,375
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:56,458 --> 00:02:00,587
She resisted, she kept her honor.

12
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,925
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,723
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:16,270
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,900
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:27,447
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,452
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:36,123
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:42,754
Now she will never be beautiful again.

20
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,679
Sorry.

21
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,650
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:06,403
These two boys were brought to trial.

23
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,282
The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,

24
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:12,492
but suspended the sentence.

25
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,665
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

26
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,254
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

27
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:27,841
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

28
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:34,681
Then I said to my wife, " For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."

29
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:44,483
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

30
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:50,697
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

31
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:52,449
What is that?

32
00:04:03,585 --> 00:04:05,420
I want them dead.

33
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,850
That I cannot do.

34
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:22,688
I 'll give you anything you ask.

35
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:30,612
I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

36
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,827
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

37
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:41,748
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

38
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:46,837
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

39
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,674
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

40
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,176
I didn't want to get into trouble.

41
00:04:54,302 --> 00:04:55,929
I understand.

42
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:00,308
You found Paradise in America.

43
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:07,274
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

44
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:10,068
You didn't need a friend like me.

45
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:15,282
But now you come to me and say,

46
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:17,784
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

47
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:22,539
But you don't ask with respect.

48
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:27,335
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

49
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:35,927
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

50
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:38,555
I ask you for justice.

51
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,641
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

52
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:46,146
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

53
00:05:48,273 --> 00:05:50,567
How much shall I pay you?

54
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:09,169
Bonasera, Bonasera.

55
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:13,340
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

56
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:17,010
If you'd come in friendship,

57
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:21,515
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

58
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:27,813
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

59
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:33,568
And then they would fear you.

60
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:39,199
Be my friend?

61
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:44,704
Godfather?

62
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,252
Good.

63
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:57,551
Some day, and that day may never
come, I 'll ask a service of you.

64
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:01,054
But until that day

65
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:07,144
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

66
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,646
<i>- Gràzie, Godfather.
- Prego.</i>

67
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:19,406
Give this to Clemenza.

68
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,162
I want people that aren't going to
get carried away.

69
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:29,416
We're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker says.

70
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:58,111
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

71
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:02,324
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

72
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:11,124
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

73
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,467
Don Barzini.

74
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:22,153
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.

75
00:09:22,237 --> 00:09:24,489
Paulie! More wine.

76
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:31,538
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

77
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:33,873
Take a walk and do your job.

78
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,884
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

79
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:47,429
You watch yourself, all right?

80
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:12,829
20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.

81
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:16,166
In that little silk purse.

82
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:19,836
<i>If this were somebody else's wedding…
Sfortunato!</i>

83
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,171
Hey, Paulie!

84
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:25,050
I got two gabagool, capocol,
and a prosciut.

85
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,217
Stupid jerk!

86
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:37,270
What's the matter?

87
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:52,118
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

88
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:56,456
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

89
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,300
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me.

90
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,350
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

91
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:19,396
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

92
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,696
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

93
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:35,078
Come here, come here, come here!

94
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:53,888
…but towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

95
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:57,058
so for six months
he's worked in my pastry shop.

96
00:11:57,142 --> 00:11:59,894
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

97
00:11:59,978 --> 00:12:01,938
Now that the war is over,

98
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:06,025
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

99
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:10,989
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo…

100
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:16,703
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

101
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,165
You understand everything.

102
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:23,376
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

103
00:12:26,504 --> 00:12:30,467
Wait till you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!

104
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,303
The bride, the groom and the angel…

105
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:43,104
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

106
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:48,318
Give it to a Jew Congressman in
another district. Who else is on the list?

107
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:56,951
Hey, Michael!

108
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:20,225
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

109
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:28,441
Is this necessary?

110
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:33,154
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

111
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:39,911
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me

112
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:42,830
on the wedding day of your daughter.

113
00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:45,333
May their first child
be a masculine child.

114
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:47,961
Michael…

115
00:13:49,754 --> 00:13:53,132
That man over there
is talking to himself.

116
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:56,052
See that scary guy over there?

117
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,639
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

118
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:04,394
His name is Luca Brasi.
He helps my father out sometimes.

119
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:09,107
Michael, he's coming over here!

120
00:14:13,444 --> 00:14:15,280
You look terrific!

121
00:14:15,363 --> 00:14:18,658
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

122
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,662
Your father's been asking for you.

123
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:25,582
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

124
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,044
Why does your brother
have a different name?

125
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:34,007
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen
in the street.

126
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,011
He had no home,
so my father took him in.

127
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:42,849
He's been with us ever since.

128
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:44,892
He's a good lawyer.

129
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:50,315
Not a Sicilian. I think
he's going to be consigliere.

130
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:53,318
- What's that?
- That's a,

131
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:57,196
like a counselor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.

132
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,366
You like your lasagna?

133
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:06,831
Don Corleone.

134
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:09,584
I'm honored and grateful

135
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:13,504
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding.

136
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:21,804
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

137
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:26,726
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

138
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:33,274
I pledge my ever -ending loyalty.

139
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:40,657
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

140
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,870
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.

141
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,747
Thank you.

142
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:39,590
Signora Corleone!

143
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,636
No!

144
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:57,835
Senator Cauley apologized for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

145
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,173
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

146
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,427
What is that outside?

147
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,066
Johnny! Johnny!

148
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:22,777
I love you!

149
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,499
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

150
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:40,086
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

151
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:45,424
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

152
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,860
You never said
you knew Johnny Fontane!

153
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:08,030
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

154
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:11,951
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

155
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:13,119
How?

156
00:19:15,663 --> 00:19:18,499
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael…

157
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,993
Please, Michael. Tell me.

158
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:02,543
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

159
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:05,504
with a big bandleader.

160
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,842
And as his career got better and better,
he wanted to get out of it.

161
00:20:10,885 --> 00:20:13,596
Johnny is my father's godson.

162
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,016
My father went to see this bandleader.

163
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:20,978
He offered him $ 10,000
to let Johnny go,

164
00:20:21,062 --> 00:20:23,814
but the bandleader said no.

165
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:29,278
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

166
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,282
Within an hour,

167
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:38,871
he signed a release
for a certified check of $ 1,000.

168
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:44,835
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

169
00:20:46,504 --> 00:20:51,384
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

170
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:56,722
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

171
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,354
That's a true story.

172
00:21:14,782 --> 00:21:17,451
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

173
00:21:29,964 --> 00:21:31,716
Beautiful!

174
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:06,083
I'll take care of it.

175
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:08,044
Tom…

176
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:11,839
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

177
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:22,058
How are you, Fredo?

178
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:24,727
My brother Fredo, this is Kay Adams.

179
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,105
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

180
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:34,570
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

181
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:37,239
Yeah. This is your friend?

182
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:41,994
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

183
00:22:43,704 --> 00:22:50,169
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

184
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:55,591
But this… man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

185
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,928
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

186
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:03,182
He won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

187
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:08,729
Sonny?

188
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:11,524
Sonny?

189
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:19,198
Sonny?

190
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:22,785
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

191
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,745
The old man wants you.

192
00:23:25,996 --> 00:23:27,706
One minute.

193
00:23:42,138 --> 00:23:47,184
A month ago he bought the movie rights
to this book, a best -seller.

194
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:50,855
The main character
is a guy just like me.

195
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:53,607
I wouldn't even have to act.

196
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:57,403
Godfather, I don't know what to do.

197
00:23:58,696 --> 00:24:02,992
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

198
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:08,789
Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood
finocchio that cries like a woman?

199
00:24:08,873 --> 00:24:12,918
"What can I do? What can I do?"
What is that nonsense?

200
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:14,712
Ridiculous.

201
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:22,553
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

202
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:24,263
Good.

203
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:29,018
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

204
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:38,110
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

205
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:43,490
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

206
00:24:43,574 --> 00:24:46,702
It's too late,
they start shooting in a week.

207
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,955
I'm going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

208
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:57,796
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

209
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:03,010
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

210
00:25:28,077 --> 00:25:33,374
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.

211
00:25:33,457 --> 00:25:37,086
Do we give your son -in -law
something important?

212
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:42,508
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

213
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:45,386
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

214
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:49,932
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

215
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:54,436
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

216
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:59,858
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

217
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:05,322
If there's nothing else, I 'd like to go
to my daughter's wedding.

218
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:10,452
Carlo, we're going to take the picture.

219
00:26:11,495 --> 00:26:13,289
Wait a minute.

220
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,666
No, Michael. Not me.

221
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:23,048
Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!

222
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,370
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.

223
00:28:16,453 --> 00:28:19,873
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

224
00:28:19,957 --> 00:28:23,710
This friend would give
his friendship to Mr. Woltz,

225
00:28:23,794 --> 00:28:26,630
if Mr. Woltz would grant us a favor.

226
00:28:26,713 --> 00:28:29,049
Woltz is listening.

227
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:33,220
Give Johnny the part in that war film
you're starting next week.

228
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:43,939
And what favor would your friend
grant Mr. Woltz?

229
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:47,568
He could make your future union
problems disappear.

230
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:51,738
And one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

231
00:28:51,822 --> 00:28:56,118
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son -of-a -bitch!

232
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,787
Let me lay it on the line.

233
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:00,873
Johnny Fontane
will never get that movie!

234
00:29:00,998 --> 00:29:05,502
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

235
00:29:05,586 --> 00:29:09,423
- I'm German -Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut -Mick friend.

236
00:29:09,506 --> 00:29:13,886
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened…

237
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:17,347
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

238
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:20,976
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

239
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,061
I'll wait for your call.

240
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:27,774
By the way,
I admire your pictures very much.

241
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,072
Check him out.

242
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:59,139
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

243
00:29:59,223 --> 00:30:03,727
- It used to decorate a king's palace.
- Very nice.

244
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,188
Why didn't you say
you work for Corleone?

245
00:30:06,313 --> 00:30:10,526
I thought you were some cheap hustler
Johnny was running in.

246
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:13,946
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

247
00:30:14,071 --> 00:30:17,533
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

248
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:20,202
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?

249
00:30:23,163 --> 00:30:26,208
There you are. $600,000 on four hoofs.

250
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:30,254
I bet Russian czars never paid
that for a single horse.

251
00:30:30,337 --> 00:30:31,880
Khartoum.

252
00:30:32,506 --> 00:30:33,799
Khartoum.

253
00:30:35,342 --> 00:30:39,721
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

254
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,849
Thanks, Tony.

255
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:46,562
Let's get something to eat.

256
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:50,065
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

257
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:54,570
To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

258
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:58,574
I respect it.
Tell him to ask me anything else.

259
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:00,993
This favor I can't give him.

260
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:04,371
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

261
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:10,627
You don't understand.
Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.

262
00:31:10,711 --> 00:31:14,381
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

263
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:18,594
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

264
00:31:20,596 --> 00:31:25,267
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.

265
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:30,731
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

266
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:35,444
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

267
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:38,322
Let me be even more frank.

268
00:31:38,405 --> 00:31:43,410
To show you that I'm not a hard -hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

269
00:31:43,493 --> 00:31:47,122
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

270
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:52,628
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

271
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:58,842
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

272
00:31:58,925 --> 00:32:00,636
And she runs off.

273
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,058
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

274
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:11,313
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

275
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,732
You get the hell out of here!

276
00:32:13,815 --> 00:32:18,195
If that goombah tries any rough stuff,
tell him I'm no bandleader.

277
00:32:19,488 --> 00:32:22,491
Yeah, I heard that story.

278
00:32:23,325 --> 00:32:27,329
Thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

279
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:30,290
Maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

280
00:32:30,374 --> 00:32:33,960
Mr. Corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately.

281
00:34:26,656 --> 00:34:30,577
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

282
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,747
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

283
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,081
Now…

284
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:40,629
Sollozzo is known as The Turk.

285
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:42,672
He's supposed to be very good
with a knife,

286
00:34:42,756 --> 00:34:47,177
<i>but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.</i>

287
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,514
<i>His business is narcotics.</i>

288
00:34:50,597 --> 00:34:53,975
<i>He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.</i>

289
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:57,896
<i>In Sicily he has plants
to process them into heroin.</i>

290
00:34:57,979 --> 00:35:01,483
<i>He needs cash,
he needs protection from the police.</i>

291
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:05,487
<i>He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.</i>

292
00:35:05,612 --> 00:35:10,826
<i>The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.</i>

293
00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:16,706
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

294
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,543
He's known as a top narcotics man.

295
00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:24,297
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

296
00:35:26,633 --> 00:35:28,009
Tom?

297
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:32,264
<i>Yes. There's more money in narcotics
than anything else.</i>

298
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:37,102
<i>If we don't get into it, somebody else
will, maybe the five families.</i>

299
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:41,648
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

300
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:43,817
Then they come after us.

301
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:50,448
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

302
00:35:50,532 --> 00:35:55,662
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in 10 years' time.

303
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:03,295
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

304
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:09,801
Don Corleone.

305
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:15,181
I need a man who has powerful friends.

306
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:18,018
I need a million dollars in cash.

307
00:36:18,101 --> 00:36:23,940
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

308
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,404
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30%.

309
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:33,450
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

310
00:36:33,533 --> 00:36:35,535
And then it would go up.

311
00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:40,165
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

312
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,002
My compliments.

313
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:51,092
I'll take care of them, out of my share.

314
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:55,472
So I receive 30% for finance,

315
00:36:55,555 --> 00:36:58,892
political influence and legal protection?

316
00:36:58,975 --> 00:37:00,685
That's right.

317
00:37:01,978 --> 00:37:05,899
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

318
00:37:05,982 --> 00:37:11,279
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance,

319
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,531
te salud, Don Corleone.

320
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:29,297
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

321
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:31,633
to be treated with respect.

322
00:37:36,304 --> 00:37:39,599
But, I must say no to you.

323
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:43,603
And I'll give you my reason.

324
00:37:43,687 --> 00:37:46,523
It's true,
I have a lot of friends in politics.

325
00:37:47,774 --> 00:37:52,195
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

326
00:37:52,278 --> 00:37:57,909
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

327
00:37:57,993 --> 00:38:02,998
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

328
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:08,336
But your business is… a little dangerous.

329
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,841
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

330
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:16,428
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our…
- Wait a minute.

331
00:38:23,727 --> 00:38:28,523
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children, and I spoil them.

332
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,860
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway…

333
00:38:31,985 --> 00:38:37,365
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to
congratulate you on your new business.

334
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:40,910
I know you'll do well, and good luck.

335
00:38:40,994 --> 00:38:45,832
Especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

336
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:08,396
Santino.

337
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,315
Come here.

338
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,569
What's the matter with you?

339
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:19,282
Your brain is going soft
from playing with that girl.

340
00:39:19,365 --> 00:39:23,495
Never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

341
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:26,039
Go on.

342
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:32,837
Tom, what's this nonsense?

343
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:36,341
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

344
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:41,262
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

345
00:39:42,555 --> 00:39:44,099
And

346
00:39:45,141 --> 00:39:47,310
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

347
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:56,861
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

348
00:39:56,945 --> 00:39:59,906
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

349
00:40:00,907 --> 00:40:04,536
Go to the Tattaglias.

350
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:08,915
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

351
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:12,669
and find out what you can.

352
00:40:30,145 --> 00:40:33,439
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

353
00:40:33,523 --> 00:40:38,194
and a tie for Freddy,
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

354
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:41,531
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

355
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:15,356
<i>Andiamo, Fredo.</i>

356
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,860
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

357
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:22,947
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

358
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:27,952
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

359
00:41:31,372 --> 00:41:33,541
<i>Buon natale, Caro. Gràzie.</i>

360
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:20,463
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

361
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,391
You know who I am?

362
00:42:31,474 --> 00:42:32,809
I know you.

363
00:42:34,102 --> 00:42:37,689
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family… right?

364
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:42,694
I think you and I can do business.

365
00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:47,198
I need someone strong like you.

366
00:42:47,824 --> 00:42:50,660
I heard you are not happy…

367
00:42:51,077 --> 00:42:53,371
…with the Corleone family.

368
00:42:54,122 --> 00:42:55,873
Want to join me?

369
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,002
What's in it for me?

370
00:43:01,629 --> 00:43:04,549
$50,000 to start with.

371
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:07,802
Not bad!

372
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,097
Agreed?

373
00:44:10,531 --> 00:44:14,243
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

374
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:19,290
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

375
00:44:19,374 --> 00:44:22,418
Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.

376
00:44:24,253 --> 00:44:28,758
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

377
00:44:28,841 --> 00:44:30,301
Get in.

378
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:45,024
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.

379
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:54,659
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

380
00:46:22,205 --> 00:46:26,250
Would you like me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

381
00:46:29,378 --> 00:46:30,379
No.

382
00:46:30,463 --> 00:46:34,842
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

383
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:39,388
Michael.

384
00:46:39,472 --> 00:46:41,891
No, I wouldn't like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

385
00:46:41,974 --> 00:46:43,768
What's the matter?

386
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,329
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

387
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:28,896
<i>- Sonny, it's Michael.
- Where have you been?</i>

388
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,732
<i>- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.</i>

389
00:47:31,816 --> 00:47:35,861
<i>There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.</i>

390
00:47:37,822 --> 00:47:41,075
<i>- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.</i>

391
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,080
<i>- Where have you been? I was worried.
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?</i>

392
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:50,209
<i>No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?</i>

393
00:47:57,675 --> 00:47:59,260
Oh, my God.

394
00:48:03,264 --> 00:48:04,682
Sonny!

395
00:48:13,566 --> 00:48:15,860
Stay back there.

396
00:48:15,943 --> 00:48:18,613
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.

397
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:24,285
There's more news about your old man.

398
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:26,537
Word is out that he's already dead.

399
00:48:26,954 --> 00:48:30,875
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

400
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:34,295
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

401
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,797
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

402
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:40,676
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

403
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:45,598
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him
to my father's house right now.

404
00:48:45,681 --> 00:48:48,768
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

405
00:48:57,943 --> 00:49:01,947
I'm going to have a couple of our people
come over to the house.

406
00:49:04,867 --> 00:49:07,036
<i>- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?</i>

407
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,955
<i>- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.</i>

408
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:13,751
<i>In three hours he'll be released
with our proposition.</i>

409
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:17,171
<i>Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.</i>

410
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:21,884
<i>What's done is done. Don't lose that
famous temper of yours, Sonny.</i>

411
00:49:21,967 --> 00:49:23,678
I'll wait.

412
00:49:38,025 --> 00:49:40,027
Your boss is dead.

413
00:49:42,863 --> 00:49:47,284
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

414
00:49:48,369 --> 00:49:52,248
I want you to help the Corleones
and me.

415
00:49:56,210 --> 00:50:00,715
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

416
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:03,426
Drink it.

417
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:11,642
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

418
00:50:15,855 --> 00:50:18,649
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

419
00:50:20,025 --> 00:50:22,862
And you knew
it was the right thing to do.

420
00:50:24,029 --> 00:50:29,160
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

421
00:50:30,578 --> 00:50:37,084
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

422
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:42,256
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

423
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:47,553
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.

424
00:50:50,556 --> 00:50:53,559
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

425
00:50:57,438 --> 00:51:01,400
Well, now he's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

426
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:09,074
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

427
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:16,123
It's good business, Tom.

428
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:22,338
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

429
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:27,176
Yeah, well…

430
00:51:29,011 --> 00:51:31,388
Let me worry about Luca.

431
00:51:36,602 --> 00:51:38,979
You just talk to Sonny.

432
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:41,315
And the other two kids.

433
00:51:44,276 --> 00:51:46,779
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

434
00:51:49,156 --> 00:51:51,575
Now you can go.

435
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:03,087
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

436
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:05,631
Blood is a big expense.

437
00:52:26,861 --> 00:52:28,737
He's still alive.

438
00:52:28,821 --> 00:52:32,783
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

439
00:52:32,867 --> 00:52:37,621
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

440
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:27,171
Your mother is at the hospital with
your father. Looks like he'll pull through.

441
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:35,638
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon…

442
00:53:35,721 --> 00:53:39,141
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.

443
00:53:39,224 --> 00:53:41,685
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

444
00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:46,065
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

445
00:53:46,148 --> 00:53:49,944
If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.

446
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:53,614
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

447
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:57,743
- Hey, do me a favor…
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

448
00:53:59,828 --> 00:54:05,042
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?

449
00:54:06,168 --> 00:54:12,383
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

450
00:54:12,466 --> 00:54:18,138
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

451
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:22,768
This is almost 1 946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

452
00:54:22,851 --> 00:54:24,520
If your father dies

453
00:54:26,939 --> 00:54:28,691
you make the deal.

454
00:54:28,774 --> 00:54:33,654
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

455
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:39,743
What is it?

456
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:46,542
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

457
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:48,752
Tessio, go see what it is.

458
00:54:52,089 --> 00:54:54,341
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

459
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:58,178
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

460
00:54:58,262 --> 00:55:01,849
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

461
00:55:01,932 --> 00:55:04,560
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

462
00:55:06,311 --> 00:55:12,359
Take care of that son -of-a -bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

463
00:55:12,443 --> 00:55:16,030
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

464
00:55:16,113 --> 00:55:20,409
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

465
00:55:20,492 --> 00:55:24,204
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

466
00:55:26,749 --> 00:55:30,461
Hanging around the house
on the phone would be a big help.

467
00:55:31,336 --> 00:55:33,255
Try Luca again.

468
00:55:42,181 --> 00:55:44,933
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

469
00:55:45,017 --> 00:55:47,895
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

470
00:56:01,617 --> 00:56:03,702
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

471
00:56:03,786 --> 00:56:05,454
Probably late.

472
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:11,668
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

473
00:56:13,921 --> 00:56:18,425
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear -view mirror.

474
00:56:19,968 --> 00:56:23,388
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

475
00:56:23,472 --> 00:56:29,353
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

476
00:56:29,436 --> 00:56:32,940
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

477
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:36,777
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

478
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,612
Watch the kids.

479
00:56:49,498 --> 00:56:55,295
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill.

480
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:56,797
Yeah, all right.

481
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,301
Make sure they're clean, because
the guys will be there a long time.

482
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:05,639
- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

483
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:09,685
Exterminate! Watch out,
so we don't exterminate you!

484
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,902
Pull over. I've got to take a leak.

485
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:03,989
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

486
00:58:22,174 --> 00:58:25,052
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

487
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:29,097
- Yeah.
- Phone call!

488
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:37,356
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

489
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:44,071
<i>- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?</i>

490
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:46,156
He's going to make it.

491
00:58:46,615 --> 00:58:48,450
<i>I love you.</i>

492
00:58:49,868 --> 00:58:51,495
I>I love you!

493
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:54,957
<i>- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.</i>

494
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,960
<i>- Tell me you love me.
- I can't talk.</i>

495
00:58:58,043 --> 00:58:59,920
<i>Can't you say it?</i>

496
00:59:01,129 --> 00:59:03,006
I'll see you tonight.

497
00:59:03,799 --> 00:59:06,927
Why don't you tell that nice girl
you love her?

498
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:11,807
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

499
00:59:12,891 --> 00:59:17,771
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

500
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:21,483
You start with a little oil,
then fry some garlic.

501
00:59:21,608 --> 00:59:27,239
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

502
00:59:27,322 --> 00:59:31,410
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

503
00:59:33,287 --> 00:59:35,372
Add a little bit of wine.

504
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:43,046
And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.

505
00:59:43,171 --> 00:59:47,426
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

506
00:59:47,509 --> 00:59:49,720
You won't see him no more.

507
00:59:51,179 --> 00:59:53,682
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

508
00:59:53,765 --> 00:59:57,269
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital…

509
00:59:57,352 --> 01:00:00,689
He'll be all right.
Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

510
01:00:00,772 --> 01:00:02,774
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

511
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:08,196
Send somebody with him anyway.

512
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:39,311
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

513
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:45,442
No, Kay. There will be detectives there,
people from the press.

514
01:00:45,525 --> 01:00:47,652
I'll wait in the cab.

515
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,908
I don't want you to get involved.

516
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:57,871
When will I see you again?

517
01:01:04,211 --> 01:01:08,340
Go back to New Hampshire,
and I'll call you at your parents' house.

518
01:01:10,092 --> 01:01:14,805
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.

519
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:30,857
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

520
01:03:30,941 --> 01:03:34,444
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

521
01:03:34,528 --> 01:03:36,863
What happened to the guards?

522
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:42,369
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

523
01:03:42,452 --> 01:03:45,789
The police made them leave
about 10 minutes ago.

524
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:54,256
Get me Long Beach 45620, please.

525
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,135
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

526
01:04:03,181 --> 01:04:08,019
Sonny, I'm at the hospital.
I got here late, there's nobody here.

527
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:12,399
No Tessio's men,
no detectives, nobody. Papa's all alone.

528
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:14,985
<i>- Don't panic.
- I won't panic.</i>

529
01:04:16,444 --> 01:04:19,322
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

530
01:04:22,033 --> 01:04:24,869
We're going to move him
to another room.

531
01:04:24,953 --> 01:04:27,956
Can you disconnect the tubes?

532
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:31,585
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

533
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:35,964
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

534
01:04:36,047 --> 01:04:37,841
Help me, please.

535
01:05:54,918 --> 01:05:58,713
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the baker.

536
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:01,800
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

537
01:06:01,883 --> 01:06:05,011
You'd better go,
there's going to be trouble.

538
01:06:05,095 --> 01:06:09,724
If there is trouble, I'll stay here
to help you. For your father.

539
01:06:11,726 --> 01:06:15,855
Listen. Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital, all right?

540
01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:18,024
I'll be out in a minute.

541
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:35,542
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

542
01:06:37,502 --> 01:06:39,546
I'm with you now.

543
01:06:41,172 --> 01:06:42,716
I'm with you.

544
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:20,336
Get rid of these. Come here.

545
01:07:21,296 --> 01:07:25,717
Put your hand in your pocket,
like you have a gun. You'll be all right.

546
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,728
You did good.

547
01:09:07,277 --> 01:09:10,488
I thought all you Guinea hoods
were locked up!

548
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:15,201
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

549
01:09:15,285 --> 01:09:19,205
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

550
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:25,253
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

551
01:09:26,087 --> 01:09:29,382
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

552
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:33,303
- He's a war hero. He's never been…
- I said take him in!

553
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:41,728
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

554
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:43,688
Stand him up straight.

555
01:10:05,835 --> 01:10:11,466
I'm the Corleones' attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

556
01:10:11,549 --> 01:10:13,968
They're licensed to carry firearms.

557
01:10:14,052 --> 01:10:18,473
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

558
01:10:18,556 --> 01:10:20,558
Let him go.

559
01:10:52,966 --> 01:10:56,886
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

560
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:59,847
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

561
01:10:59,931 --> 01:11:03,101
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.

562
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:06,229
Jesus Christ.

563
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:15,405
Looks like a fortress around here.

564
01:11:17,532 --> 01:11:22,912
Tamaduch! Hey… 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

565
01:11:22,996 --> 01:11:26,582
That Turk shows one hair on his ass,
he's dead.

566
01:11:28,626 --> 01:11:30,712
Mike, let me look at you.

567
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:37,802
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

568
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:43,516
The Turk wants to talk!
Imagine the nerve of the son -of-a -bitch.

569
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:46,352
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

570
01:11:46,477 --> 01:11:51,274
What did he say… He wants us to send
Michael to hear the proposition.

571
01:11:51,357 --> 01:11:54,819
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

572
01:11:54,902 --> 01:11:57,989
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

573
01:11:58,072 --> 01:12:02,368
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

574
01:12:02,452 --> 01:12:05,580
No more! Not this time, Consigliere.

575
01:12:05,663 --> 01:12:09,208
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

576
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:12,336
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war…

577
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:15,381
- The other families…
- They hand me Sollozzo!

578
01:12:15,465 --> 01:12:17,759
This is business, not personal!

579
01:12:17,842 --> 01:12:22,263
- They shot my father…
- Even that was business, not personal.

580
01:12:23,181 --> 01:12:26,934
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favor.

581
01:12:27,018 --> 01:12:31,022
No more advice on how
to patch things up. Just help me win.

582
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:41,240
I found out about Captain McCluskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

583
01:12:41,324 --> 01:12:45,620
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

584
01:12:45,703 --> 01:12:49,749
McCluskey has agreed
to be The Turk's bodyguard.

585
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:53,586
So when Sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

586
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:57,256
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

587
01:12:57,381 --> 01:13:03,304
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

588
01:13:03,387 --> 01:13:07,225
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

589
01:13:08,518 --> 01:13:12,355
Do me a favor.
Take this into consideration.

590
01:13:16,192 --> 01:13:18,194
All right, we'll wait.

591
01:13:23,616 --> 01:13:26,452
We can't wait. We can't wait.

592
01:13:27,912 --> 01:13:31,874
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

593
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:35,670
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

594
01:13:35,753 --> 01:13:40,049
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

595
01:13:40,133 --> 01:13:44,720
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

596
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:52,770
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

597
01:13:53,646 --> 01:13:58,067
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

598
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:02,071
Let's set the meeting.

599
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,952
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

600
01:14:09,787 --> 01:14:13,583
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

601
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:17,420
Some place where there are people,
so I feel safe.

602
01:14:20,173 --> 01:14:23,176
They'll search me
when I meet them, right?

603
01:14:23,259 --> 01:14:25,595
So I can't have a weapon on me.

604
01:14:28,973 --> 01:14:33,936
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me

605
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:41,110
then I'll kill them both.

606
01:14:53,206 --> 01:14:57,919
Nice college boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

607
01:14:58,044 --> 01:15:01,672
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

608
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:08,304
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

609
01:15:08,387 --> 01:15:11,432
You're taking this very personal.

610
01:15:11,515 --> 01:15:14,936
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

611
01:15:15,061 --> 01:15:18,522
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey…

612
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:24,737
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

613
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:30,076
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

614
01:15:30,201 --> 01:15:34,747
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

615
01:15:36,207 --> 01:15:40,044
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

616
01:15:43,714 --> 01:15:47,301
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

617
01:15:50,513 --> 01:15:52,056
It's as cold as they come.

618
01:15:52,139 --> 01:15:55,393
Impossible to trace,
so you don't worry about prints.

619
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:59,855
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

620
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:14,120
Is the trigger too tight?

621
01:16:17,456 --> 01:16:18,666
My ears!

622
01:16:18,749 --> 01:16:23,379
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain -in -the -ass innocent bystanders.

623
01:16:24,547 --> 01:16:27,466
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

624
01:16:29,844 --> 01:16:33,514
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

625
01:16:33,597 --> 01:16:37,143
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

626
01:16:37,226 --> 01:16:41,647
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

627
01:16:41,731 --> 01:16:44,608
so walk out fast, but don't run.

628
01:16:44,692 --> 01:16:48,112
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

629
01:16:48,195 --> 01:16:51,699
They'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

630
01:16:53,743 --> 01:16:57,997
You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation,
nobody knows where,

631
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,166
and we'll catch the hell.

632
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:04,628
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

633
01:17:04,712 --> 01:17:07,757
All the other families will probably
line up against us.

634
01:17:07,882 --> 01:17:13,429
These things have to happen every five,
10 years. Gets rid of the bad blood.

635
01:17:13,554 --> 01:17:17,975
Been 10 years since the last one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.

636
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:23,814
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

637
01:17:25,232 --> 01:17:29,737
You know, Mike, we were all proud
of you. Being a hero and all.

638
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:31,530
Your father too.

639
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:13,030
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

640
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:18,244
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

641
01:18:18,327 --> 01:18:20,663
How much time do we have?

642
01:18:21,539 --> 01:18:26,335
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

643
01:18:27,336 --> 01:18:32,216
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

644
01:18:33,592 --> 01:18:38,139
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

645
01:18:38,264 --> 01:18:43,352
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

646
01:18:43,436 --> 01:18:46,814
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

647
01:18:46,897 --> 01:18:50,943
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

648
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:54,363
Sollozzo might not even be
in the car, Sonny!

649
01:18:54,447 --> 01:18:55,948
I'll get it.

650
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:23,392
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

651
01:19:23,476 --> 01:19:26,812
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

652
01:19:26,937 --> 01:19:32,651
A police captain is on call 24 hours
a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.

653
01:19:32,735 --> 01:19:37,615
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

654
01:19:37,698 --> 01:19:42,661
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

655
01:19:43,412 --> 01:19:48,584
They've got an old -fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

656
01:19:50,586 --> 01:19:53,672
We might be able to
tape the gun behind it.

657
01:19:53,756 --> 01:19:57,885
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

658
01:19:57,968 --> 01:20:01,847
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

659
01:20:01,931 --> 01:20:07,269
Then you go to take a leak. No,
better still, you ask permission to go.

660
01:20:07,353 --> 01:20:11,815
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

661
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:16,070
I want somebody very good
to plant that gun.

662
01:20:16,153 --> 01:20:19,657
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

663
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:25,287
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

664
01:20:25,371 --> 01:20:27,039
Let's move.

665
01:20:32,545 --> 01:20:35,714
Did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

666
01:20:35,798 --> 01:20:37,675
Yeah, a million times.

667
01:20:42,429 --> 01:20:46,642
Don't forget. Two shots apiece
in the head as soon as you come out.

668
01:20:53,232 --> 01:20:56,819
How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

669
01:20:57,653 --> 01:20:59,738
At least a year.

670
01:20:59,863 --> 01:21:04,660
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not
seeing her before you leave and…

671
01:21:06,203 --> 01:21:10,040
I'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

672
01:21:15,879 --> 01:21:17,381
Take care.

673
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:21,927
Take care, Mike.

674
01:21:54,752 --> 01:21:58,547
I'm glad you came. I hope
we can straighten everything out.

675
01:21:59,757 --> 01:22:04,845
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

676
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:09,266
I want to straighten everything out.
Don't want my father bothered again.

677
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:12,603
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

678
01:22:13,604 --> 01:22:16,899
But you have to keep an open mind
when we talk.

679
01:22:16,982 --> 01:22:21,403
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

680
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,948
He's a good kid.

681
01:22:29,036 --> 01:22:32,414
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

682
01:22:32,498 --> 01:22:36,585
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

683
01:22:41,715 --> 01:22:46,387
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

684
01:22:47,805 --> 01:22:51,642
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

685
01:22:53,936 --> 01:22:55,354
He's clean.

686
01:23:21,964 --> 01:23:24,258
Going to Jersey?

687
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:28,303
Maybe.

688
01:23:53,579 --> 01:23:55,372
Nice work, Lou.

689
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:38,081
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

690
01:24:38,165 --> 01:24:39,833
I'll have it.

691
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:18,580
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.

692
01:25:24,804 --> 01:25:26,804
I am sorry.<br />Forget about it.

693
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:32,110
You - got to know

694
01:25:32,734 --> 01:25:36,234
The hit on your father
was a matter of business.

695
01:25:38,058 --> 01:25:40,558
Look - I have much respect for your father.

696
01:25:41,182 --> 01:25:44,282
But - your father's thinkink is outdated.

697
01:25:46,306 --> 01:25:50,506
And you have to understand...I
am a man of honor.

698
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:53,930
I under...stand

699
01:25:54,954 --> 01:25:55,954
very clearly...

700
01:25:55,978 --> 01:25:57,578
I am glad

701
01:26:09,602 --> 01:26:15,202
And you need to be clear...why
I work with the Tattaglia family...

702
01:26:17,026 --> 01:26:20,026
because once I make a deal...

703
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:23,950
I want peace.

704
01:26:23,974 --> 01:26:26,774
Let's stop all this nonsense.

705
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:28,898
I want to...um...

706
01:26:31,322 --> 01:26:32,322
What?

707
01:26:34,046 --> 01:26:36,046
How to say this?

708
01:26:38,201 --> 01:26:39,870
What I want…

709
01:26:40,829 --> 01:26:42,998
What's most important to me

710
01:26:45,751 --> 01:26:49,963
is that I have a guarantee.
No more attempts on my father's life.

711
01:26:50,047 --> 01:26:54,801
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

712
01:26:54,885 --> 01:26:58,430
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

713
01:26:58,513 --> 01:27:00,349
I'm not that clever.

714
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:04,102
All I want is a truce.

715
01:27:10,651 --> 01:27:14,488
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

716
01:27:15,864 --> 01:27:18,367
When you got to go, you got to go.

717
01:27:23,872 --> 01:27:25,791
He's clean.

718
01:27:25,874 --> 01:27:27,960
Don't take too long.

719
01:27:31,088 --> 01:27:32,881
I've frisked a thousand punks.

720
01:28:48,905 --> 01:28:50,305
You ok?

721
01:28:52,529 --> 01:28:54,529
Okay, I want you to
understand something...

722
01:28:54,553 --> 01:28:56,653
You're Italian, just like your father.

723
01:28:58,977 --> 01:29:00,977
Your father, is in bad shape.

724
01:29:03,001 --> 01:29:06,301
Surely you can see...that he will
need your help when he is better again.

725
01:29:07,025 --> 01:29:09,025
This fight has to end!

726
01:29:10,749 --> 01:29:13,449
You need to help me...
so we can end this.

727
01:32:23,505 --> 01:32:25,507
Okay, you take over.

728
01:32:42,774 --> 01:32:44,609
I love you, Grandpa.

729
01:32:47,529 --> 01:32:50,240
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

730
01:32:51,574 --> 01:32:54,661
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

731
01:32:54,786 --> 01:33:01,042
"I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

732
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:06,339
Go with your mother.

733
01:33:06,423 --> 01:33:08,550
Take them downstairs.

734
01:33:14,681 --> 01:33:16,725
Go on, Carlo, you too.

735
01:33:18,435 --> 01:33:20,145
Go on.

736
01:33:40,749 --> 01:33:44,753
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

737
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:06,358
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

738
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:12,989
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

739
01:34:13,073 --> 01:34:16,576
They hit us, so we hit them back.

740
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:21,956
Through our newspaper contacts
we've been able to put out material

741
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:26,336
about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo
in the drug rackets.

742
01:34:26,419 --> 01:34:28,546
So things are loosening up.

743
01:34:29,798 --> 01:34:34,552
And I'm sending Fredo to Las Vegas,

744
01:34:34,636 --> 01:34:37,180
under the protection
of Don Francesco of L.A.

745
01:34:37,305 --> 01:34:41,810
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

746
01:34:50,151 --> 01:34:51,945
Where's Michael?

747
01:35:04,249 --> 01:35:07,377
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

748
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:13,007
But he's safe. We're starting to work
to bring him back.

749
01:35:34,404 --> 01:35:36,841
I want you to find out
where that old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

750
01:35:36,865 --> 01:35:38,825
I want him now.

751
01:35:42,537 --> 01:35:47,250
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

752
01:35:47,333 --> 01:35:53,339
- He must get better first. I'll decide…
- War is costly. We can't do business.

753
01:35:53,423 --> 01:35:57,260
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

754
01:35:57,385 --> 01:36:02,307
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

755
01:36:02,432 --> 01:36:08,480
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere. I wouldn't be in this shape!

756
01:36:08,563 --> 01:36:10,857
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

757
01:36:14,444 --> 01:36:16,738
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

758
01:36:17,906 --> 01:36:20,867
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

759
01:36:21,784 --> 01:36:26,164
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

760
01:36:26,247 --> 01:36:30,418
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

761
01:36:30,502 --> 01:36:33,838
That's because
they've started making big money.

762
01:36:33,922 --> 01:36:37,217
Papa never talked business
at the table.

763
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:41,179
- Shut up, Connie…
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

764
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:43,014
Don't interfere.

765
01:36:45,308 --> 01:36:49,229
I 'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family…

766
01:36:49,312 --> 01:36:52,106
We don't discuss business at the table.

767
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,948
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

768
01:37:47,495 --> 01:37:49,497
Why are you so far
from the house?

769
01:37:50,164 --> 01:37:52,834
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

770
01:37:52,917 --> 01:37:54,210
The bodyguards are here.

771
01:37:55,128 --> 01:37:56,462
It's still dangerous…

772
01:37:57,589 --> 01:37:59,340
We've heard from Santino
in New York…

773
01:38:00,758 --> 01:38:03,011
Your enemies know you're here.

774
01:38:05,013 --> 01:38:06,764
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

775
01:38:07,432 --> 01:38:08,725
Not yet.

776
01:38:09,392 --> 01:38:11,227
It's out of the question.

777
01:38:14,689 --> 01:38:16,107
Where are you going now?

778
01:38:17,775 --> 01:38:18,818
To Corleone.

779
01:38:19,444 --> 01:38:20,695
Take my car.

780
01:38:24,032 --> 01:38:25,074
I want to walk.

781
01:38:27,702 --> 01:38:28,870
Be careful.

782
01:39:03,404 --> 01:39:04,781
Where have all the men gone?

783
01:39:05,823 --> 01:39:08,034
They're all dead from vendettas.

784
01:39:09,661 --> 01:39:12,080
There are the names of the dead.

785
01:39:28,471 --> 01:39:32,600
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I.!

786
01:39:32,684 --> 01:39:36,979
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I.!
Clark Gable!

787
01:39:37,105 --> 01:39:42,360
America! Take me to the America, G. I.!
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

788
01:40:00,294 --> 01:40:02,338
Mamma mia what a beauty.

789
01:40:10,513 --> 01:40:13,599
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

790
01:40:19,814 --> 01:40:23,818
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

791
01:40:46,507 --> 01:40:48,676
Did you have a good hunt?

792
01:40:49,635 --> 01:40:52,013
You know all the girls
around here?

793
01:40:52,513 --> 01:40:54,015
We saw some real beauties.

794
01:40:54,849 --> 01:40:58,352
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

795
01:41:01,564 --> 01:41:04,317
She would tempt the devil himself.

796
01:41:11,949 --> 01:41:14,118
Really put together.

797
01:41:14,202 --> 01:41:15,244
Right, Calo?

798
01:41:18,998 --> 01:41:21,000
Such hair, such mouth!

799
01:41:23,377 --> 01:41:26,547
The girls around here are
beautiful… but virtuous.

800
01:41:27,089 --> 01:41:29,467
This one had a purple dress…

801
01:41:29,842 --> 01:41:31,969
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

802
01:41:38,434 --> 01:41:40,269
Do you know her?

803
01:41:44,690 --> 01:41:47,485
There's no girl like that
in this town.

804
01:41:50,196 --> 01:41:51,405
My God, I understand!

805
01:41:55,535 --> 01:41:56,536
What's wrong?

806
01:41:58,746 --> 01:42:00,122
Let's go.

807
01:42:02,083 --> 01:42:03,334
It's his daughter.

808
01:42:03,793 --> 01:42:05,294
Tell him to come here.

809
01:42:08,714 --> 01:42:10,049
Call him.

810
01:42:30,111 --> 01:42:32,446
Fabrizio, you translate.

811
01:42:36,576 --> 01:42:38,452
I apologize if I offended you.

812
01:42:39,453 --> 01:42:42,874
I'm a stranger in this country.

813
01:42:42,957 --> 01:42:46,043
I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

814
01:42:51,507 --> 01:42:54,385
I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.

815
01:42:55,803 --> 01:42:58,139
My name is Michael Corleone.

816
01:43:00,182 --> 01:43:04,312
There are people who'd pay
a lot of money for that information.

817
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,525
But then your daughter
would lose a father

818
01:43:11,110 --> 01:43:13,487
instead of gaining a husband.

819
01:43:21,662 --> 01:43:23,873
I want to meet your daughter.

820
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:29,128
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

821
01:43:29,795 --> 01:43:31,464
With all respect.

822
01:43:37,511 --> 01:43:41,515
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

823
01:43:47,021 --> 01:43:48,522
What's her name?

824
01:46:43,864 --> 01:46:46,033
I'll knock you dizzy.

825
01:46:51,789 --> 01:46:53,874
Save it for the library.

826
01:46:57,545 --> 01:47:00,214
We've got to pick up my sister.

827
01:47:18,274 --> 01:47:19,984
What's the matter?

828
01:47:22,444 --> 01:47:24,238
What's the matter?

829
01:47:26,031 --> 01:47:27,950
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

830
01:47:28,033 --> 01:47:31,203
It was my fault. I hit him.

831
01:47:31,287 --> 01:47:35,082
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me…

832
01:47:40,296 --> 01:47:43,591
I'm just going to get a doctor
to take a look at you.

833
01:47:43,674 --> 01:47:46,177
Sonny, please don't do anything.

834
01:47:48,137 --> 01:47:50,222
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

835
01:47:50,306 --> 01:47:53,184
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

836
01:47:57,730 --> 01:48:00,941
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?

837
01:48:01,025 --> 01:48:03,694
Tell them to stop taking in action.

838
01:48:04,528 --> 01:48:06,238
We lost enough money last week.

839
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:15,414
Come here, come here!

840
01:49:12,346 --> 01:49:15,683
If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you.

841
01:53:08,916 --> 01:53:13,170
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

842
01:53:13,253 --> 01:53:17,591
Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling.

843
01:53:17,674 --> 01:53:21,512
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.

844
01:53:21,595 --> 01:53:24,139
All we know is that he's all right.

845
01:53:26,683 --> 01:53:30,312
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

846
01:53:31,438 --> 01:53:35,567
Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.
Please?

847
01:53:37,110 --> 01:53:42,282
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

848
01:53:43,283 --> 01:53:45,160
He'll get in touch with you.

849
01:53:45,285 --> 01:53:48,956
I let my cab go,
so can I call another one, please?

850
01:53:49,039 --> 01:53:50,916
Come on. Sorry.

851
01:54:08,141 --> 01:54:12,813
<i>- Hello?
- Is Carlo there?</i>

852
01:54:13,605 --> 01:54:16,066
<i>- Who is this?
- A friend of Carlo.</i>

853
01:54:16,149 --> 01:54:19,528
<i>Tell him that I can't make it tonight
until later.</i>

854
01:54:25,284 --> 01:54:26,535
Bitch!

855
01:54:28,537 --> 01:54:31,331
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.

856
01:54:31,415 --> 01:54:34,751
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.

857
01:54:34,835 --> 01:54:38,213
<i>- You just told me to make you dinner!
- Vafangool!</i>

858
01:54:38,422 --> 01:54:40,549
I'll vafangoolyou!

859
01:54:45,387 --> 01:54:48,181
She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.

860
01:54:52,519 --> 01:54:56,857
That's it, break it all,
you spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all!

861
01:55:06,074 --> 01:55:09,202
Why don't you bring
your whore home for dinner?

862
01:55:10,203 --> 01:55:11,872
Maybe I will.

863
01:55:18,629 --> 01:55:21,798
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

864
01:55:21,882 --> 01:55:25,802
You skinny, spoiled brat.
Clean it up! Clean it up!

865
01:55:25,886 --> 01:55:30,390
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

866
01:55:30,474 --> 01:55:35,312
Clean it up. Clean that up, you…

867
01:55:38,565 --> 01:55:40,275
Clean it!

868
01:55:40,359 --> 01:55:44,613
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.
Be a murderer, like your father!

869
01:55:44,696 --> 01:55:48,158
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

870
01:55:48,241 --> 01:55:49,951
Come on, kill me!

871
01:55:51,495 --> 01:55:53,163
Get out of here!

872
01:55:53,246 --> 01:55:56,667
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

873
01:55:56,750 --> 01:55:59,419
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!

874
01:56:09,888 --> 01:56:12,849
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

875
01:56:13,975 --> 01:56:17,020
Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.

876
01:56:17,104 --> 01:56:20,023
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

877
01:56:21,316 --> 01:56:23,110
Yeah, Connie.

878
01:56:27,781 --> 01:56:29,741
You wait there.

879
01:56:32,369 --> 01:56:34,913
No, you just wait there.

880
01:56:37,082 --> 01:56:39,334
Son -of-a -bitch.

881
01:56:39,418 --> 01:56:42,629
- Son -of-a -bitch!
- What's the matter?

882
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:49,886
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

883
01:56:57,894 --> 01:56:59,146
Sonny!

884
01:57:05,610 --> 01:57:07,612
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

885
01:57:08,697 --> 01:57:10,574
Go after him, go on!

886
01:57:40,312 --> 01:57:42,355
Son -of-a -bitch. Come on!

887
01:59:31,047 --> 01:59:32,883
Give me a drop.

888
01:59:41,308 --> 01:59:43,602
My wife is crying upstairs.

889
01:59:45,979 --> 01:59:48,481
I hear cars coming to the house.

890
01:59:53,153 --> 01:59:56,072
<i>Consigliere of mine,</i>

891
01:59:56,156 --> 01:59:59,659
tell your Don
what everyone seems to know.

892
01:59:59,743 --> 02:00:02,120
I didn't tell Mama anything.

893
02:00:03,079 --> 02:00:06,333
I was about to come up and wake you
and tell you.

894
02:00:09,836 --> 02:00:12,047
But you needed a drink first.

895
02:00:14,382 --> 02:00:15,634
Yeah.

896
02:00:18,929 --> 02:00:21,431
Well, now you've had your drink.

897
02:00:26,978 --> 02:00:30,857
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

898
02:00:47,916 --> 02:00:50,460
I want no inquiries made.

899
02:00:54,923 --> 02:00:57,467
I want no acts of vengeance.

900
02:00:59,177 --> 02:01:02,013
I want you to arrange a meeting

901
02:01:03,014 --> 02:01:05,642
with the heads of the five families.

902
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:09,646
This war stops now.

903
02:01:31,584 --> 02:01:34,129
Call Bonasera.

904
02:01:34,212 --> 02:01:36,381
I need him now.

905
02:01:48,768 --> 02:01:53,940
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling
for Vito Corleone, at his request.

906
02:01:54,024 --> 02:01:56,401
You owe your Don a service.

907
02:01:56,484 --> 02:02:00,030
<i>He has no doubt that you will repay it.</i>

908
02:02:00,113 --> 02:02:04,451
<i>He will be at your funeral parlor
in one hour. Be there to greet him.</i>

909
02:02:25,638 --> 02:02:30,435
Well, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

910
02:02:30,518 --> 02:02:33,605
Yes. What do you want me to do?

911
02:02:50,622 --> 02:02:53,541
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

912
02:03:09,557 --> 02:03:12,685
Look how they massacred my boy.

913
02:03:41,714 --> 02:03:44,968
It's safer to teach you English!

914
02:03:45,718 --> 02:03:47,137
I know English…

915
02:03:47,220 --> 02:03:52,016
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

916
02:03:59,232 --> 02:04:01,025
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

917
02:04:01,734 --> 02:04:03,736
How are things in Palermo?

918
02:04:09,742 --> 02:04:13,788
Michael is teaching me to
drive… watch, I'll show you.

919
02:04:16,583 --> 02:04:18,418
How are things in Palermo?

920
02:04:18,793 --> 02:04:21,921
Young people don't respect
anything anymore…

921
02:04:23,006 --> 02:04:26,384
times are changing for the worse.

922
02:04:28,636 --> 02:04:32,056
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

923
02:04:34,767 --> 02:04:39,939
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa… right now.

924
02:04:45,945 --> 02:04:47,113
What's wrong?

925
02:04:48,239 --> 02:04:50,450
Bad news from America.

926
02:04:52,911 --> 02:04:56,623
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

927
02:05:03,213 --> 02:05:05,048
Let's go… you promised.

928
02:05:23,858 --> 02:05:24,859
Fabrizio!

929
02:05:24,943 --> 02:05:26,361
Get the car.

930
02:05:27,737 --> 02:05:31,908
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

931
02:05:31,991 --> 02:05:35,578
No, take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

932
02:05:35,662 --> 02:05:37,580
Okay, anything you say.

933
02:05:43,503 --> 02:05:45,255
Calo, where is Apollonia?

934
02:05:46,005 --> 02:05:49,509
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

935
02:05:51,803 --> 02:05:53,846
She'll make a good American wife.

936
02:05:55,306 --> 02:05:57,850
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

937
02:06:08,111 --> 02:06:10,280
Fabrizio!

938
02:06:10,363 --> 02:06:12,031
Where are you going?

939
02:06:13,741 --> 02:06:16,160
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

940
02:06:22,292 --> 02:06:23,710
No, Apollonia!

941
02:06:46,774 --> 02:06:52,613
Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organize this meeting,

942
02:06:52,739 --> 02:06:57,577
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

943
02:06:59,329 --> 02:07:02,457
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

944
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:05,877
and from Brooklyn

945
02:07:07,503 --> 02:07:09,589
Philip Tattaglia.

946
02:07:11,382 --> 02:07:14,093
And from Staten Island

947
02:07:14,177 --> 02:07:17,680
we have with us Victor Strachi.

948
02:07:17,764 --> 02:07:23,394
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

949
02:07:23,478 --> 02:07:27,231
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

950
02:07:34,072 --> 02:07:37,533
How did things ever get so far?

951
02:07:37,617 --> 02:07:39,243
I don't know.

952
02:07:41,287 --> 02:07:44,791
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

953
02:07:47,919 --> 02:07:51,339
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

954
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:57,220
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

955
02:07:57,303 --> 02:08:01,307
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

956
02:08:02,767 --> 02:08:06,396
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

957
02:08:06,479 --> 02:08:11,859
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

958
02:08:11,943 --> 02:08:16,030
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

959
02:08:16,114 --> 02:08:20,326
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

960
02:08:20,410 --> 02:08:23,287
He refused to share them.

961
02:08:23,371 --> 02:08:27,166
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

962
02:08:27,250 --> 02:08:29,627
All of you know me.

963
02:08:30,545 --> 02:08:35,716
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

964
02:08:37,385 --> 02:08:43,224
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

965
02:08:43,307 --> 02:08:47,562
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

966
02:08:47,645 --> 02:08:53,609
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

967
02:08:53,734 --> 02:08:58,448
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

968
02:08:58,531 --> 02:09:02,743
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

969
02:09:02,827 --> 02:09:07,957
I believed that then
and I believe that now.

970
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:10,251
Times have changed.

971
02:09:10,376 --> 02:09:15,089
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

972
02:09:15,173 --> 02:09:18,050
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

973
02:09:18,134 --> 02:09:23,556
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

974
02:09:23,639 --> 02:09:28,227
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

975
02:09:29,312 --> 02:09:32,899
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

976
02:09:32,982 --> 02:09:35,568
After all, we're not communists.

977
02:09:38,696 --> 02:09:41,782
I also don't believe in drugs.

978
02:09:41,908 --> 02:09:46,746
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

979
02:09:46,829 --> 02:09:49,957
Somebody says to them
" I have powders."

980
02:09:50,041 --> 02:09:53,294
"If you put up
3 -4,000 dollar investment,

981
02:09:53,586 --> 02:09:56,380
we can make 50,000 distributing."

982
02:09:57,590 --> 02:10:03,513
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

983
02:10:03,596 --> 02:10:08,392
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

984
02:10:08,476 --> 02:10:10,269
<i>That's an infàmia.</i>

985
02:10:11,604 --> 02:10:15,525
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored.

986
02:10:15,608 --> 02:10:18,819
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

987
02:10:25,451 --> 02:10:29,038
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

988
02:10:30,456 --> 02:10:37,088
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

989
02:10:37,630 --> 02:10:42,218
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

990
02:10:42,301 --> 02:10:46,597
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

991
02:10:46,681 --> 02:10:50,434
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

992
02:10:50,518 --> 02:10:53,813
As time goes by
and his position becomes stronger,

993
02:10:53,896 --> 02:10:56,566
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

994
02:10:56,649 --> 02:11:01,779
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

995
02:11:01,862 --> 02:11:04,740
You talk about vengeance.

996
02:11:04,824 --> 02:11:08,077
Will vengeance
bring your son back to you?

997
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:10,705
Or my boy to me?

998
02:11:10,788 --> 02:11:13,583
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

999
02:11:16,377 --> 02:11:18,671
But I have selfish reasons.

1000
02:11:20,965 --> 02:11:24,552
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

1001
02:11:26,429 --> 02:11:28,973
because of this Sollozzo business.

1002
02:11:30,516 --> 02:11:34,437
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

1003
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:37,189
Cleared of all these false charges.

1004
02:11:38,608 --> 02:11:41,736
But I'm a superstitious man.

1005
02:11:41,861 --> 02:11:47,158
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

1006
02:11:48,534 --> 02:11:52,121
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

1007
02:11:52,204 --> 02:11:55,082
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

1008
02:11:56,375 --> 02:11:59,962
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1009
02:12:01,631 --> 02:12:03,966
And that I do not forgive.

1010
02:12:06,427 --> 02:12:08,804
But, that aside

1011
02:12:11,891 --> 02:12:14,226
let me say that I swear

1012
02:12:15,853 --> 02:12:18,981
on the souls of my grandchildren,

1013
02:12:19,065 --> 02:12:23,444
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1014
02:12:48,928 --> 02:12:54,392
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

1015
02:12:54,475 --> 02:12:56,602
Mention it. Don't insist.

1016
02:12:58,604 --> 02:13:03,526
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

1017
02:13:05,152 --> 02:13:07,113
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1018
02:13:08,197 --> 02:13:11,325
He could never have outfought Santino.

1019
02:13:13,703 --> 02:13:19,291
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

1020
02:13:34,765 --> 02:13:36,851
Come on, Nancy.

1021
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:40,646
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

1022
02:13:41,981 --> 02:13:43,649
Okay, all right.

1023
02:13:56,746 --> 02:13:58,956
How long have you been back?

1024
02:13:59,749 --> 02:14:01,584
I've been back a year.

1025
02:14:03,002 --> 02:14:05,129
Longer than that, I think.

1026
02:14:07,965 --> 02:14:10,134
It's good to see you, Kay.

1027
02:14:21,187 --> 02:14:23,731
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1028
02:14:26,233 --> 02:14:29,236
He's been sick. Very sick.

1029
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:32,740
But you're not like him.

1030
02:14:32,823 --> 02:14:36,619
You told me you weren't going to
become like your father.

1031
02:14:38,537 --> 02:14:42,833
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1032
02:14:42,917 --> 02:14:46,378
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1033
02:14:47,588 --> 02:14:50,007
Like a senator or president.

1034
02:14:50,090 --> 02:14:52,551
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

1035
02:14:52,635 --> 02:14:55,471
They don't have men killed.

1036
02:14:58,891 --> 02:15:00,893
Who's being naive, Kay?

1037
02:15:02,144 --> 02:15:06,398
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1038
02:15:07,942 --> 02:15:12,321
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1039
02:15:14,156 --> 02:15:18,118
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay…

1040
02:15:19,578 --> 02:15:22,706
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1041
02:15:23,999 --> 02:15:28,838
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1042
02:15:28,921 --> 02:15:32,424
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1043
02:15:32,508 --> 02:15:36,345
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because… I want you to marry me.

1044
02:15:38,055 --> 02:15:40,641
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay…

1045
02:15:42,393 --> 02:15:46,272
I'll do anything you ask
to make up for what's happened to us.

1046
02:15:47,940 --> 02:15:52,194
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

1047
02:15:53,737 --> 02:15:56,991
we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1048
02:15:58,576 --> 02:16:01,287
That we have children. Our children.

1049
02:16:02,788 --> 02:16:04,957
Kay, I need you.

1050
02:16:06,917 --> 02:16:08,502
And I love you.

1051
02:16:30,649 --> 02:16:34,403
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

1052
02:16:34,528 --> 02:16:38,157
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

1053
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:41,368
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1054
02:16:41,452 --> 02:16:44,580
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

1055
02:16:44,663 --> 02:16:48,125
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

1056
02:16:48,208 --> 02:16:52,087
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

1057
02:16:53,589 --> 02:16:55,758
Don Corleone…

1058
02:16:55,841 --> 02:16:59,970
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1059
02:17:00,054 --> 02:17:04,099
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1060
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:07,770
Michael is now head of the family.

1061
02:17:07,853 --> 02:17:12,149
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1062
02:17:12,232 --> 02:17:14,610
After we make the move to Nevada

1063
02:17:14,693 --> 02:17:19,114
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1064
02:17:19,198 --> 02:17:23,535
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

1065
02:17:23,619 --> 02:17:26,872
Forgive me, but with you gone,

1066
02:17:26,956 --> 02:17:29,792
me and Pete
will come under Barzini's thumb.

1067
02:17:29,875 --> 02:17:35,547
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1068
02:17:35,631 --> 02:17:38,550
- Do you have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1069
02:17:38,634 --> 02:17:41,553
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1070
02:17:41,637 --> 02:17:44,890
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1071
02:17:49,812 --> 02:17:55,150
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1072
02:17:55,234 --> 02:17:57,569
That's all I can tell you now.

1073
02:17:58,404 --> 02:18:00,990
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1074
02:18:01,073 --> 02:18:04,451
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right -hand man.

1075
02:18:04,535 --> 02:18:09,331
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1076
02:18:09,415 --> 02:18:11,959
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1077
02:18:12,042 --> 02:18:16,755
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1078
02:18:36,775 --> 02:18:40,612
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1079
02:18:40,696 --> 02:18:43,615
Mike… Why am I out?

1080
02:18:45,117 --> 02:18:47,828
You're not a wartime consigliere. Tom.

1081
02:18:49,121 --> 02:18:52,374
Things may get rough with the move.

1082
02:18:52,458 --> 02:18:53,751
Tom.

1083
02:18:58,922 --> 02:19:04,094
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1084
02:19:04,178 --> 02:19:08,307
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

1085
02:19:09,767 --> 02:19:12,978
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1086
02:19:13,979 --> 02:19:18,942
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1087
02:19:19,985 --> 02:19:23,030
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

1088
02:20:12,204 --> 02:20:16,500
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

1089
02:20:16,625 --> 02:20:21,213
This doctor did some job.
Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

1090
02:20:21,296 --> 02:20:25,425
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

1091
02:20:25,509 --> 02:20:27,886
Let me open the door, all right?

1092
02:20:34,059 --> 02:20:39,481
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

1093
02:20:39,565 --> 02:20:42,192
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

1094
02:20:46,113 --> 02:20:49,199
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

1095
02:20:50,409 --> 02:20:53,912
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

1096
02:20:55,330 --> 02:20:58,750
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

1097
02:21:00,294 --> 02:21:04,965
- Hey, Mike…
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1098
02:21:05,048 --> 02:21:07,718
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

1099
02:21:13,599 --> 02:21:16,894
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

1100
02:21:16,977 --> 02:21:19,104
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

1101
02:21:20,814 --> 02:21:22,941
Hey, come on! Scram!

1102
02:21:24,610 --> 02:21:28,155
Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

1103
02:21:28,238 --> 02:21:29,531
Sorry.

1104
02:21:31,491 --> 02:21:34,036
I don't know. He's tired.

1105
02:21:44,213 --> 02:21:48,550
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

1106
02:21:48,634 --> 02:21:50,594
Well, give him a call.

1107
02:21:51,970 --> 02:21:55,098
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

1108
02:21:55,182 --> 02:21:57,392
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

1109
02:21:57,476 --> 02:22:01,063
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1110
02:22:01,146 --> 02:22:03,398
Well, I owe it all to him.

1111
02:22:04,608 --> 02:22:06,193
He knows how grateful you are.

1112
02:22:06,276 --> 02:22:09,529
That's why
he'd like to ask a favor of you.

1113
02:22:09,613 --> 02:22:11,531
Mike, what can I do?

1114
02:22:12,699 --> 02:22:15,160
We're thinking of giving up our interests

1115
02:22:15,244 --> 02:22:18,163
in the olive oil business
and settling here.

1116
02:22:18,997 --> 02:22:24,336
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.

1117
02:22:24,419 --> 02:22:27,172
- Tom!
- Are you sure?

1118
02:22:27,256 --> 02:22:30,259
Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1119
02:22:30,342 --> 02:22:33,053
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1120
02:22:34,346 --> 02:22:36,765
See, Johnny…

1121
02:22:36,848 --> 02:22:41,061
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

1122
02:22:41,144 --> 02:22:44,898
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1123
02:22:47,818 --> 02:22:52,447
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1124
02:22:53,699 --> 02:22:55,826
We're counting on you.

1125
02:22:57,828 --> 02:23:01,498
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

1126
02:23:01,581 --> 02:23:02,874
Good.

1127
02:23:04,501 --> 02:23:09,131
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

1128
02:23:09,214 --> 02:23:11,758
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

1129
02:23:11,883 --> 02:23:16,972
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

1130
02:23:17,055 --> 02:23:20,642
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

1131
02:23:23,312 --> 02:23:26,064
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

1132
02:23:27,816 --> 02:23:29,651
Buy me out?

1133
02:23:29,735 --> 02:23:32,321
The casino, the hotel.

1134
02:23:32,404 --> 02:23:35,324
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1135
02:23:35,407 --> 02:23:40,829
The Corleone family wants
to buy me out? No, I buy you out.

1136
02:23:40,912 --> 02:23:44,333
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1137
02:23:44,416 --> 02:23:48,295
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

1138
02:23:53,091 --> 02:23:55,510
You Guineas make me laugh.

1139
02:23:55,635 --> 02:24:00,223
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1140
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:05,020
You did that
because we bankrolled your casino

1141
02:24:05,103 --> 02:24:10,359
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

1142
02:24:10,442 --> 02:24:13,195
Yes. First of all, you're all done.

1143
02:24:13,278 --> 02:24:15,739
You don't have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1144
02:24:15,864 --> 02:24:20,243
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

1145
02:24:20,327 --> 02:24:24,247
Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

1146
02:24:24,331 --> 02:24:29,378
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1147
02:24:29,461 --> 02:24:32,964
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

1148
02:24:33,048 --> 02:24:37,886
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

1149
02:24:37,969 --> 02:24:42,182
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1150
02:24:42,265 --> 02:24:47,020
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

1151
02:24:51,066 --> 02:24:53,902
You straightened my brother out?

1152
02:24:53,985 --> 02:24:58,448
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1153
02:24:58,532 --> 02:25:00,492
What's wrong with you?

1154
02:25:05,372 --> 02:25:08,500
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1155
02:25:09,418 --> 02:25:11,044
Son -of-a -bitch!

1156
02:25:11,128 --> 02:25:16,299
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

1157
02:25:16,383 --> 02:25:18,885
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

1158
02:25:20,011 --> 02:25:23,557
<i>Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don…</i>

1159
02:25:23,682 --> 02:25:29,062
Just a minute. Don is semi -retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

1160
02:25:29,146 --> 02:25:32,482
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1161
02:25:37,362 --> 02:25:42,200
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1162
02:25:42,951 --> 02:25:44,161
Fredo…

1163
02:25:45,370 --> 02:25:48,123
You're my older brother, and I love you.

1164
02:25:49,583 --> 02:25:53,587
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

1165
02:25:55,088 --> 02:25:56,089
Ever.

1166
02:26:04,222 --> 02:26:08,393
I have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

1167
02:26:10,145 --> 02:26:15,025
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

1168
02:26:22,407 --> 02:26:25,452
Your sister wants to ask you something.

1169
02:26:25,535 --> 02:26:27,662
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1170
02:26:27,746 --> 02:26:30,707
They want you to be godfather
to their boy.

1171
02:26:30,790 --> 02:26:32,626
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1172
02:26:32,709 --> 02:26:35,045
Let me think about it. Come on.

1173
02:26:43,929 --> 02:26:46,806
Barzini will move against you first.

1174
02:26:46,890 --> 02:26:51,311
He'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

1175
02:26:51,394 --> 02:26:53,438
Guaranteeing your safety.

1176
02:26:54,689 --> 02:26:57,776
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

1177
02:27:02,489 --> 02:27:05,492
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

1178
02:27:06,910 --> 02:27:10,413
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

1179
02:27:15,460 --> 02:27:16,962
I don't know.

1180
02:27:19,005 --> 02:27:21,925
Are you happy with your wife
and children?

1181
02:27:22,884 --> 02:27:25,720
- Very happy.
- That's good.

1182
02:27:27,597 --> 02:27:32,477
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

1183
02:27:32,561 --> 02:27:35,522
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

1184
02:27:36,982 --> 02:27:39,985
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

1185
02:27:41,528 --> 02:27:44,990
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1186
02:27:48,326 --> 02:27:50,662
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1187
02:27:50,787 --> 02:27:53,498
He looks more like you every day.

1188
02:27:56,209 --> 02:28:00,672
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

1189
02:28:02,799 --> 02:28:04,843
Read the funny papers.

1190
02:28:12,058 --> 02:28:17,689
I want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in - and out -going calls.

1191
02:28:17,814 --> 02:28:23,111
- I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.
- That's right. I forgot.

1192
02:28:27,157 --> 02:28:28,867
What's the matter?

1193
02:28:29,701 --> 02:28:31,745
What's bothering you?

1194
02:28:35,332 --> 02:28:39,961
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it,
so I'll handle it.

1195
02:28:53,224 --> 02:28:57,729
I knew that Santino
would have to go through all this.

1196
02:28:57,812 --> 02:28:59,439
And Fredo…

1197
02:29:02,150 --> 02:29:04,194
Fredo was, well…

1198
02:29:06,071 --> 02:29:08,907
But I never wanted this for you.

1199
02:29:11,242 --> 02:29:16,289
I worked my whole life. I don't apologize
for taking care of my family.

1200
02:29:16,373 --> 02:29:20,293
And I refused to be a fool,

1201
02:29:20,377 --> 02:29:24,506
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1202
02:29:26,466 --> 02:29:29,928
I don't apologize. That's my life,
but I thought that,

1203
02:29:31,596 --> 02:29:36,768
that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

1204
02:29:38,561 --> 02:29:44,234
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

1205
02:29:44,317 --> 02:29:47,320
<i>Another pezzonovante.</i>

1206
02:29:47,404 --> 02:29:49,072
Well…

1207
02:29:52,283 --> 02:29:56,204
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1208
02:29:56,287 --> 02:29:59,791
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

1209
02:30:04,629 --> 02:30:09,092
Now listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

1210
02:30:09,175 --> 02:30:12,137
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

1211
02:30:29,112 --> 02:30:31,239
Can I hold it, please?

1212
02:30:46,337 --> 02:30:50,216
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

1213
02:30:50,300 --> 02:30:53,094
Over here, over here.

1214
02:30:54,971 --> 02:30:57,474
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1215
02:31:03,855 --> 02:31:05,607
Anthony!

1216
02:31:05,690 --> 02:31:07,358
Come here, come here.

1217
02:31:12,530 --> 02:31:15,200
That's it. We'll put it right there.

1218
02:31:20,413 --> 02:31:22,999
I'll show you something. Come here.

1219
02:31:25,043 --> 02:31:26,920
Stand there.

1220
02:31:30,673 --> 02:31:32,425
Give me an orange!

1221
02:31:50,777 --> 02:31:52,570
That's a new trick.

1222
02:31:53,571 --> 02:31:55,907
You run in there. Run in there.

1223
02:32:09,462 --> 02:32:11,422
Where are you?

1224
02:35:09,100 --> 02:35:11,477
Mike, can I have a minute?

1225
02:35:21,571 --> 02:35:24,032
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1226
02:35:24,115 --> 02:35:27,410
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

1227
02:35:28,077 --> 02:35:30,288
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1228
02:35:31,622 --> 02:35:35,418
I can arrange security. On my territory.

1229
02:35:38,463 --> 02:35:41,007
- All right?
- All right.

1230
02:35:58,524 --> 02:36:01,486
Do you know
how they're going to come at you?

1231
02:36:03,988 --> 02:36:07,658
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

1232
02:36:09,827 --> 02:36:11,621
Where I'll be safe.

1233
02:36:23,883 --> 02:36:27,470
I always thought it would be Clemenza,
not Tessio.

1234
02:36:27,553 --> 02:36:31,349
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

1235
02:36:33,601 --> 02:36:34,894
But I'm going to wait.

1236
02:36:35,561 --> 02:36:36,562
After the baptism.

1237
02:36:40,441 --> 02:36:44,028
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1238
02:36:44,112 --> 02:36:48,282
And then I'll meet
with Don Barzini and Tattaglia.

1239
02:36:49,867 --> 02:36:52,829
All the heads of the five families.

1240
02:39:13,803 --> 02:39:18,766
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?

1241
02:39:18,849 --> 02:39:20,017
I do.

1242
02:39:20,101 --> 02:39:23,604
<i>Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?</i>

1243
02:39:23,688 --> 02:39:24,689
<i>I do.</i>

1244
02:39:24,772 --> 02:39:28,818
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?</i>

1245
02:39:28,901 --> 02:39:30,194
<i>I do.</i>

1246
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:40,097
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1247
02:40:46,354 --> 02:40:47,605
I do renounce him.

1248
02:40:57,281 --> 02:40:58,699
And all his works?

1249
02:41:12,588 --> 02:41:13,631
I do renounce them.

1250
02:41:15,383 --> 02:41:16,634
Oh, God!

1251
02:41:19,553 --> 02:41:23,224
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1252
02:41:43,285 --> 02:41:44,495
I will.

1253
02:41:51,627 --> 02:41:57,133
Michael Rizzi, go in peace,
and may the Lord be with you. Amen.

1254
02:42:11,355 --> 02:42:13,274
Kay!

1255
02:42:13,357 --> 02:42:15,317
Kiss your godfather.

1256
02:42:39,717 --> 02:42:43,804
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

1257
02:42:43,888 --> 02:42:45,556
Everybody has to leave without us.

1258
02:42:45,639 --> 02:42:48,601
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.

1259
02:42:48,726 --> 02:42:52,229
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

1260
02:42:53,355 --> 02:42:55,733
I'll only be a couple of days.

1261
02:43:11,999 --> 02:43:14,210
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1262
02:43:16,378 --> 02:43:20,132
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

1263
02:43:27,932 --> 02:43:33,354
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

1264
02:43:33,437 --> 02:43:36,982
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

1265
02:43:37,066 --> 02:43:39,235
I can't go either, Sal.

1266
02:43:51,205 --> 02:43:55,125
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

1267
02:43:56,794 --> 02:43:59,630
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1268
02:44:05,636 --> 02:44:08,097
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1269
02:44:09,265 --> 02:44:12,434
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

1270
02:44:57,855 --> 02:45:00,691
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

1271
02:45:05,571 --> 02:45:09,491
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

1272
02:45:10,534 --> 02:45:14,455
That little farce
you played with my sister.

1273
02:45:14,538 --> 02:45:19,627
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1274
02:45:19,710 --> 02:45:22,421
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

1275
02:45:25,090 --> 02:45:27,384
Don't do this to me, please.

1276
02:45:36,644 --> 02:45:38,395
Barzini is dead.

1277
02:45:40,522 --> 02:45:42,858
So is Philip Tattaglia.

1278
02:45:44,068 --> 02:45:45,569
Moe Greene.

1279
02:45:46,528 --> 02:45:50,324
Strachi. Cuneo.

1280
02:45:52,284 --> 02:45:57,539
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1281
02:45:57,623 --> 02:45:59,416
Admit what you did.

1282
02:46:03,337 --> 02:46:05,005
Get him a drink.

1283
02:46:11,303 --> 02:46:12,596
Come on.

1284
02:46:13,931 --> 02:46:16,350
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1285
02:46:16,433 --> 02:46:19,311
Do you think
I 'd make my sister a widow?

1286
02:46:20,437 --> 02:46:23,148
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1287
02:46:30,072 --> 02:46:32,116
Go ahead, drink, drink.

1288
02:46:36,912 --> 02:46:40,749
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

1289
02:46:41,834 --> 02:46:45,796
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1290
02:46:45,879 --> 02:46:47,506
Tom.

1291
02:46:51,635 --> 02:46:55,222
I want you to stay there. Understand?

1292
02:46:55,305 --> 02:46:57,891
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

1293
02:46:59,143 --> 02:47:03,397
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

1294
02:47:07,651 --> 02:47:09,695
Who approached you?

1295
02:47:10,988 --> 02:47:13,198
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1296
02:47:21,081 --> 02:47:22,791
It was Barzini.

1297
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:28,505
Good.

1298
02:47:34,720 --> 02:47:38,766
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

1299
02:47:38,849 --> 02:47:42,394
I'll call your wife
and tell her what flight you're on.

1300
02:47:46,690 --> 02:47:49,234
- Mike…
- Get out of my sight.

1301
02:48:15,385 --> 02:48:17,012
Hello, Carlo.

1302
02:49:16,864 --> 02:49:19,992
- I'm trying to tell you…
- Mama, please!

1303
02:49:28,375 --> 02:49:30,460
Michael!

1304
02:49:30,544 --> 02:49:32,546
- What is it?
- Where is he?

1305
02:49:34,965 --> 02:49:40,095
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

1306
02:49:40,178 --> 02:49:44,266
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

1307
02:49:44,349 --> 02:49:47,436
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

1308
02:49:47,519 --> 02:49:53,317
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

1309
02:49:53,400 --> 02:49:55,027
Connie.

1310
02:49:57,279 --> 02:49:59,990
Why do you think
he kept Carlo at the Mall?

1311
02:50:00,073 --> 02:50:02,910
He knew he was going to kill him.

1312
02:50:02,993 --> 02:50:08,332
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold -hearted bastard!

1313
02:50:08,415 --> 02:50:12,502
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

1314
02:50:12,586 --> 02:50:15,339
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

1315
02:50:25,015 --> 02:50:29,227
No! No, no…

1316
02:50:29,311 --> 02:50:32,689
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

1317
02:50:53,835 --> 02:50:55,545
She's hysterical.

1318
02:51:00,092 --> 02:51:01,843
Hysterical.

1319
02:51:03,845 --> 02:51:05,555
Michael, is it true?

1320
02:51:07,557 --> 02:51:11,228
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

1321
02:51:11,311 --> 02:51:14,064
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

1322
02:51:34,126 --> 02:51:35,627
All right.

1323
02:51:38,463 --> 02:51:40,215
This one time.

1324
02:51:44,177 --> 02:51:47,514
This one time
I'll let you ask me about my affairs.

1325
02:51:53,603 --> 02:51:55,022
Is it true?

1326
02:51:59,109 --> 02:52:00,610
Is it?

1327
02:52:02,362 --> 02:52:03,739
No.

1328
02:52:17,669 --> 02:52:20,630
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

1329
02:52:51,912 --> 02:52:53,622
Don Corleone.
