1
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:11,171
Ever since I got bitten by that spider,

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,300
I only had one week

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,380
where my life has felt normal.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,810
That was when you found out.

5
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,960
When you botched that spell
where you wanted everyone

6
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:31,280
to forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man,

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,280
We started getting some visitors.

8
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,900
From every universe.

9
00:00:51,324 --> 00:00:52,640
Hello, Peter.

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,440
You're not Peter Parker.

11
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,100
Sorry, what was your name again?

12
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,360
Dr. Otto Octavius.

13
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:10,330
Wait no, seriously,
what's your actual name?

14
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,640
There are others out there.
We need to send them back.

15
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,130
So,

16
00:01:16,135 --> 00:01:17,640
Scooby-Doo this crap!

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,800
You know, all this is
kinda your mess.

18
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,840
I know a couple of magic words myself
starting with the word "please".

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,170
Please,

20
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:27,650
Scooby-Doo this crap.

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,700
You're flying out into the darkness,

22
00:01:35,116 --> 00:01:36,540
to fight ghosts.

23
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:37,280
What do you mean?

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,960
They all die fighting Spider-Man.

25
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,880
It's their fate.

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,800
I'm sorry, kid.

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,924
Yeah, me too.

28
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,610
Don't-

29
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,460
Look, there has to be another way!

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,250
There isn't.

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,939
They're a danger to our universe.

32
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:01,340
You'll never take this away from me.

33
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,200
Peter...

34
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,699
You're struggling

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,900
to have everything you want

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,040
while the world tries to make you choose.

37
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:20,390
This is all my fault.
I can't save everyone.

38
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,980
What's happening?

39
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,800
They're starting to come through.

40
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,560
And I can't stop them.
