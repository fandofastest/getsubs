Can I talk to Mason?

729
00:33:09,383 --> 00:33:12,604
[Link] Sure, no problem. Just a second.

730
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:15,259
[phone rings]

731
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,132
[Link exhala]

732
00:33:19,219 --> 00:33:21,526
- Hey, boss? - [Mason] Yeah?

733
00:33:21,613 --> 00:33:23,832
I have the negotiator on the phone.

734
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,313
Okay. I have to go.

735
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,011
If it moves, you shoot it.

736
00:33:32,754 --> 00:33:35,148
[sirens blaring]

737
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,414
[footsteps knocking]

738
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:42,155
You should probably sit down for this.

739
00:33:42,242 --> 00:33:43,678
- Oh yeah? - [Link] Yes.

740
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:48,379
[chair rattles]

741
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:50,033
- [phone rings] - Go ahead.

742
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:52,209
[Amy] Hola, Mason.

743
00:33:54,863 --> 00:33:57,388
[bright music]

744
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,567
-¿Amy? - Network.

745
00:34:02,654 --> 00:34:04,438
How are you?

746
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:07,485
It does pretty well, you know, considering.

747
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:09,443
[Bright music continues]

748
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,271
No, that's a lie.

749
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:14,100
It's, it's, you know, pretty tacky to be honest.

750
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:16,885
But now that I hear your voice, no, it's not bad.

751
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:20,150
- You sound great. - Thank you.

752
00:34:20,237 --> 00:34:23,109
They.

753
00:34:23,196 --> 00:34:25,459
..I've been busting my ass with this field work. Oh yeah? How's it going?

754
00:34:25,546 --> 00:34:28,419
Well, I got promoted to the special unit.

755
00:34:28,506 --> 00:34:30,551
Really? Well, that's good.

756
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:34,338
I'm happy for you. It couldn't have happened to a better person.

757
00:34:34,425 --> 00:34:38,211
So, I have to ask, is the FBI hosting this party?

758
00:34:38,298 --> 00:34:40,083
Yes, you are not wrong.

759
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,824
Of course they caught you. The cars came quickly, huh?

760
00:34:42,911 --> 00:34:44,522
You had an advantage.

761
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:45,436
[Amy] Yes, we noticed the chat

762
00:34:45,523 --> 00:34:47,090
of the whites a couple of weeks ago.

763
00:34:47,177 --> 00:34:50,615
Oh, of course, Shawn. Careless.

764
00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:51,616
[Amy] I'm sure that only

765
00:34:51,703 --> 00:34:54,532
was trying to help you in his own way.

766
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:59,667
Hi Amy, it's me, I'm glad it's you.

767
00:34:59,754 --> 00:35:01,539
Uh, I couldn't help but notice that

768
00:35:01,626 --> 00:35:03,584
its internal surveillance is dark.

769
00:35:03,671 --> 00:35:04,933
Link did an excellent job

770
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,457
controlling the seats in its perimeter.

771
00:35:06,544 --> 00:35:09,851
Well, she's the best, isn't she?

772
00:35:09,938 --> 00:35:13,725
Um, I guess we should get to business.

773
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:15,379
[Mason] Well, okay.

774
00:35:15,466 --> 00:35:17,816
Okay, this is the part where

775
00:35:17,903 --> 00:35:19,209
you say you have everything covered.

776
00:35:19,296 --> 00:35:21,385
The entrance, the exits, you have tactics, you have

777
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,214
snipers, you have electronic surveillance.

778
00:35:24,301 --> 00:35:28,131
And I in turn tell you that I have a

779
00:35:28,218 --> 00:35:29,306
bunch of hostages and I don't want to hurt them.

780
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,916
But, you know, if you come in, I have to

781
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,657
make blah, blah, blah, blah, blah to everyone

782
00:35:32,744 --> 00:35:35,529
and each of them, what's new?

783
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:37,749
How many hostages?

784
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:40,708
[Mason] Twenty-three, if you include staff and security.

785
00:35:40,795 --> 00:35:43,320
Okay, well, if Anton is in charge of controlling

786
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,583
crowds, I'm sure you are in good hands.

787
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:49,239
Well, then I have a special request.

788
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:52,938
[Amy] Okay, shoot. I'll do my best.

789
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,114
I need 50 feet.

790
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:57,464
- 50 feet? - 50 feet.

791
00:35:57,551 --> 00:35:59,031
Why 50 feet?

792
00:35:59,118 --> 00:36:01,033
I mean, that's new.

793
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,730
Oh, I don't know, Amy.

794
00:36:02,817 --> 00:36:05,255
I guess I feel a little claustrophobic.

795
00:36:05,342 --> 00:36:07,257
Sides, front of the building, all

796
00:36:07,344 --> 00:36:10,521
back, police, tacticians, everyone.

797
00:36:10,608 --> 00:36:12,653
Oh, and it includes the sidewalk.

798
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,483
- [dramatic music] - [sirens blaring]

799
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,616
You know how I get when I'm cornered.

800
00:36:18,703 --> 00:36:20,487
[Link] What do you think he's doing?

801
00:36:20,574 --> 00:36:24,143
[laughs] He's trying to figure out 50 feet.

802
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,319
[Dramatic music continues]

803
00:36:26,406 --> 00:36:28,321
[Link] She doesn't look so comfortable in that outfit.

804
00:36:28,408 --> 00:36:30,149
It's not her.

805
00:36:30,236 --> 00:36:32,934
[Mason] No, it's not bad. I kinda like it.

806
00:36:33,021 --> 00:36:34,197
Oh, she looks good.

807
00:36:34,284 --> 00:36:37,025
Oh, she looks great.

808
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:41,204
And he's got that little boost of confidence in his voice.

809
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:43,380
Like when he beats you at pool?

810
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,425
No, she never beat me at pool.

811
00:36:45,512 --> 00:36:49,690
But [sighs] he's really doing well, isn't he?

812
00:36:50,735 --> 00:36:53,520
[laughs] Wow.

813
00:36:53,607 --> 00:36:55,827
[Dramatic music continues]

814
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:59,309
Captain, I'm going to need a 360 degree sweep of the perimeter.

815
00:36:59,396 --> 00:37:01,006
Okay, I'll let you negotiate, but

816
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:04,052
I am still in charge of this operation.

817
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,532
And I'll let you keep that narrative

818
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:07,230
as long as you do what I tell you.

819
00:37:07,317 --> 00:37:11,756
[garbled radio chatter]

820
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:14,324
[suspense music]

821
00:37:14,411 --> 00:37:17,544
Sniper 3 in position. 52 feet.

822
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:21,679
[Suspense music continues]

823
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:29,252
[clears throat] So nothing within 50 feet.

824
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:31,341
Nothing at all.

825
00:37:31,428 --> 00:37:32,864
There has to be something or I wouldn't have ordered it.

826
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,648
Okay, there's a protocol we follow here,

827
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:36,607
trade-offs, escalation, sweat equity.

828
00:37:36,694 --> 00:37:38,130
We make an hour seem like 10.

829
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:39,740
Then when the sun goes down we drill hard.

830
00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:43,309
I know the protocol and so does he.

831
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:45,268
If you don't believe that Mason is one step

832
00:37:45,355 --> 00:37:46,617
ahead of us, you are a fool.

833
00:37:46,704 --> 00:37:48,532
Mason is a wolf.

834
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:52,013
He will bite his own leg off to get out of a trap.

835
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,494
Yeah, you and he are pretty close, aren't you?

836
00:37:54,581 --> 00:37:56,148
How do I know you're not helping him?

837
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:57,541
Why should I trust you?

838
00:37:57,628 --> 00:38:00,544
It doesn't matter if you trust me.

839
00:38:00,631 --> 00:38:03,068
It is important that your superiors do so.

840
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,504
Upload that, please.

841
00:38:06,637 --> 00:38:08,552
I have known exclusively the identity

842
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:10,945
of one of the alleged thieves of

843
00:38:11,032 --> 00:38:13,731
banks, and it is none other than Mason Andrew Goddard.

844
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:15,646
My sources confirm that it is the notorious

845
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:19,258
international criminal, the ace of spades.

846
00:38:19,345 --> 00:38:22,174
Okay, we have black iced coffee.

847
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:24,045
Do you want some, uh, cream with that?

848
00:38:24,132 --> 00:38:25,699
We have hazelnuts. We have vanilla.

849
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:27,701
Ugh, gross. That's a joke, right?

850
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,182
What's happening?

851
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:31,923
The tactical team looks serious.

852
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,492
- Oh yeah. - Aren't you worried?

853
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,364
No, that's what she wants us to be, worried.

854
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:41,846
so that we make a mistake and slip up.

855
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:45,980
Okay. If there is a decoy box, there is a hidden account I need you to find it.

856
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:47,765
And what we should do is look for our escape route.

857
00:38:47,852 --> 00:38:49,419
No

858
00:38:49,506 --> 00:38:50,942
no no.

859
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:53,858
That's what she wants, okay?

860
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:55,947
We just have to stay one step ahead of her.

861
00:38:57,514 --> 00:39:00,560
[radio crackling]

862
00:39:00,647 --> 00:39:02,345
Yes, yes. Okay, I'll be there.

863
00:39:02,432 --> 00:39:04,303
Now listen, don't think too much about this.

864
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,436
Okay? I'll buy you all the time you need.

865
00:39:08,394 --> 00:39:09,134
[suspense music]

866
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,745
Oh!

867
00:39:11,832 --> 00:39:14,444
[Antón] That's it. All about me, all about me.

868
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:15,749
[Suspense music continues]

869
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:17,838
Look down. Stay to the right of that wall.

870
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:20,145
[Hector] Let's pick up the pace, people!

871
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,973
Come on. Let's move!

872
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,454
Let's go!

873
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:26,456
Face down. Don't look at me, man.

874
00:39:26,543 --> 00:39:28,022
[Hector] Keep your eyes forward!

875
00:39:29,763 --> 00:39:32,636
[stomping footsteps]

876
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:37,380
Yes, we have it clear here.

877
00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:43,429
[Suspense music continues]

878
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:47,215
[Anton] Everybody make yourself comfortable.

879
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:50,393
We'll find out about some food and drink in a minute.

880
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,873
Get to know each other, relax.

881
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,267
Consider this a vacation from your busy lives, friends.

882
00:39:57,704 --> 00:40:00,054
- What do you need? - Food and drinks.

883
00:40:00,141 --> 00:40:01,839
Alright.

884
00:40:01,926 --> 00:40:03,971
Hector and I control this entire room.

885
00:40:04,058 --> 00:40:06,496
- Isn't that right, Hec? - Yes, sir!

886
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:08,367
[Suspense music continues]

887
00:40:08,454 --> 00:40:11,065
Okay, just so you know, there is a plan.

888
00:40:11,152 --> 00:40:12,502
You are the boss.

889
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:15,069
[Suspense music continues]

890
00:40:15,156 --> 00:40:17,071
[birds chirping]

891
00:40:17,158 --> 00:40:18,464
Are you sure we can't find something visual?

892
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:21,032
Maybe just an old security camera in the hallway?

893
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,468
I mean, anything.

894
00:40:22,555 --> 00:40:23,774
She slammed it all shut.

895
00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:26,341
Landlines, feeds, everything. She is a professional.

896
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:27,604
Yes I know.

897
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,867
The Mossad subcontracted it.

898
00:40:29,954 --> 00:40:30,955
Alright.

899
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:33,871
There are 23 hostages.

900
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:36,961
They were all smart devices.

901
00:40:37,048 --> 00:40:39,485
But you know, Anton didn't let them keep any of them.

902
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,967
But a technician with your skills will probably

903
00:40:43,054 --> 00:40:45,665
could turn it back on remotely.

904
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:48,189
Yeah?

905
00:40:48,276 --> 00:40:51,018
OK that's fine.

906
00:40:51,105 --> 00:40:53,760
I have something here. Just a second.

[soft music]

908
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,591
Wait, is that spa music?

909
00:40:59,897 --> 00:41:01,246
Wow.

910
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,770
[soft music]

911
00:41:03,857 --> 00:41:04,771
Bright.

912
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:07,339

916
00:41:14,477 --> 00:41:15,695
It's for you.

917
00:41:17,567 --> 00:41:18,568
[button beep]

918
00:41:18,655 --> 00:41:20,700
That spa music was a nice touch.

919
00:41:20,787 --> 00:41:23,529
So you can remotely control someone's personal device.

920
00:41:23,616 --> 00:41:24,704
Isn't that illegal, Amy?

921
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,924
It's a grey area.

922
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:29,970
Mmm. I can't help but notice the buildup.

923
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:32,016
[Amy] Yeah, the troops are getting restless.

924
00:41:32,103 --> 00:41:34,322
Mmm. Yeah, well, we're worried here too.

925
00:41:35,498 --> 00:41:37,587
Well, I have a request for you.

926
00:41:37,674 --> 00:41:39,632
It's not fair. I gave you 50

927
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:40,633
feet, you have given me nothing.

928
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,548
Nobody gets hurt, that's fair.

929
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,029
What do you want?

930
00:41:45,116 --> 00:41:48,467
I want two dozen pizzas. A mixed variety.

931
00:41:48,554 --> 00:41:50,338
And a Hawaiian for Shawn.

932
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,559
And then for a few drinks, let's have a

933
00:41:53,646 --> 00:41:58,608
soda mix, a little water, maybe

934
00:41:58,695 --> 00:42:00,479
an apple juice for the kid and beer for me.

935
00:42:00,566 --> 00:42:01,872
In less than 30 minutes.

936
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:04,396
- Anything else? - Yes.

937
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:09,053
I want you to hand it over. Alone.

938
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,054
On the steps.

939
00:42:10,141 --> 00:42:12,360
The stopwatch started.

940
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,232
And don't forget the beer.

941
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,365
Beer? Don't you think it's a little premature?

942
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:18,845
Have some faith in me, will you?

943
00:42:18,932 --> 00:42:20,760
And I'll see you in less than 30 minutes.

- Hi, Shawn. - [Shawn] Yeah?

947
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:44,218
Check the lure box, will you?

948
00:42:44,305 --> 00:42:46,786
Check all personal things,

949
00:42:46,873 --> 00:42:48,179
like rings, lockets, whatever.

950
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:49,397
Just give me the numbers you find.

951
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,182
Like any number.

[Shawn] You knew this was a decoy box, right?

955
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,062
We have thousands of clients.

956
00:43:02,149 --> 00:43:03,890
I have no idea what you're talking about.

957
00:43:03,977 --> 00:43:04,848
[Shawn] Yeah, sure.

958
00:43:10,418 --> 00:43:13,900
I sense a little tension between you and your brother.

959
00:43:13,987 --> 00:43:15,032
How do you know he's my brother?

960
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,034
Hey, take a step back.

961
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:19,514
- Come back. - Guess.

962
00:43:19,602 --> 00:43:21,908
You confirmed it.

963
00:43:21,995 --> 00:43:23,127
You know, I have an older brother too.

964
00:43:23,214 --> 00:43:25,520
Bossy.

965
00:43:25,608 --> 00:43:27,914
I just hate Christmas gatherings because of that.

966
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:29,786
Yes, no matter what he says or does, he

967
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,265
There is always someone better than me.

968
00:43:32,745 --> 00:43:33,659
Yeah, Mason is not like that.

969
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:38,098
He treats you like a child.

970
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:39,970
I mean, this was supposed to be your big result.

971
00:43:40,057 --> 00:43:41,624
Now look, you're relegated to

972
00:43:41,711 --> 00:43:43,756
holding the bank manager hostage.

973
00:43:43,843 --> 00:43:46,063
I screwed up, I deserve it.

974
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,718
Well, is that what it makes you think?

975
00:43:48,805 --> 00:43:51,242
Enough! You don't know what the hell

976
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:52,722
you're talking, okay bro?

977
00:43:52,809 --> 00:43:53,897
Take a step back.

978
00:43:57,465 --> 00:43:58,379
Hello, Link?

979
00:43:58,466 --> 00:44:00,599
[Link] Do you still have anything?

980
00:44:00,686 --> 00:44:02,383
I think I found your number.

We are waiting for the

985

initial hostages are released.

Hello.

992
00:44:57,874 --> 00:44:59,310
Hello.

993
00:45:02,879 --> 00:45:06,709
I'd invite you in, but uh, lots of people staring.

994
00:45:06,796 --> 00:45:09,494
There is that, yes.

995
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:13,498
How many sights am I on right now?

996
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:16,631
Uh, I would say around 12.

997
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:18,677
Mmmm, great turnout.

998
00:45:18,764 --> 00:45:19,722
- I know, right? - Yes.

999
00:45:19,809 --> 00:45:22,333
You are a popular boy.

1000
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,726
Hey, I'm sorry I turned you into the

1001
00:45:23,813 --> 00:45:25,553
pizza delivery girl, but it's the only way.

1002
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,123
I could do a face to face,

1003
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,170
you know, just you and me and of course,

1004
00:45:33,257 --> 00:45:35,172
all the others, but...

1005
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:39,567
So, I'm going to need two

1006
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,265
hostages, non-negotiable, give in order to receive.

1007
00:45:41,352 --> 00:45:43,223
Well.

1008
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,399
And after that, two every hour.

1009
00:45:45,486 --> 00:45:46,661
Okay, okay.

1010
00:45:47,924 --> 00:45:50,317
You're not even going to fight back?

1011
00:45:50,404 --> 00:45:52,363
Why? It's a good and fair deal.

1012
00:45:53,538 --> 00:45:55,888
Are you exercising?

1013
00:45:55,975 --> 00:45:59,544
Uh, uh, I mean, a little bit.

1014
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,328
They.

1015
00:46:03,591 --> 00:46:05,724
.. I think it's just legwork. You know what would be cool?

1016
00:46:05,811 --> 00:46:08,945
Yes, after all this is over,

1017
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:12,252
We went to our little private island and that's it.

1018
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:15,995
you know, the one with the fishing pier and the garden?

1019
00:46:20,608 --> 00:46:23,524
I just don't want anyone to get hurt.

1020
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:26,179
No, you don't have to worry about that.

1021
00:46:26,266 --> 00:46:28,660
But this is not going to end well.

1022
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:31,402
Well, maybe, maybe not.

1023
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,447
Look, at some point, the gloves

1024
00:46:33,534 --> 00:46:35,449
They will fall and people will get hurt.

1025
00:46:35,536 --> 00:46:37,582
Well, first of all, I didn't plan this.

1026
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:38,975
This is Shawn, okay?

1027
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,933
And I'm just here to bail him out.

1028
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,195
After what happened with

1029
00:46:42,282 --> 00:46:44,937
we, I retired, just so you know.

1030
00:46:45,024 --> 00:46:48,027
So surrender now.

1031
00:46:48,114 --> 00:46:49,899
I can't do that. We'd all go to prison.

1032
00:46:49,986 --> 00:46:52,423
Well, it's better than dying under a hail of bullets.

1033
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,641
I know about that.

1034
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:55,252
My dad died in prison.

1035
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:57,645
I think I would have chosen the hailstorm.

1036
00:46:58,864 --> 00:47:00,692
I need my two hostages.

1037
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:04,522

Just look for box 2-1-3-4.

1061

[Shawn] I'm telling you, there's no 2-1-3-4 here.

[Mason] Link, notice.

1084
00:49:43,986 --> 00:49:45,639
We need a total lockdown.

1085
00:49:45,726 --> 00:49:48,860
Reverse vault surveillance.

1086
00:49:48,947 --> 00:49:50,253

You're going to throw this in my face, aren't you?

1095
00:50:24,548 --> 00:50:27,029
I'm not saying anything.

1096
00:50:28,421 --> 00:50:30,032
That's a yes.

[breathing deeply] It's not a box.

1116
00:52:52,696 --> 00:52:54,263
Very few people know that the building

1117
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,742
next door is part of the bank.

1118
00:52:55,829 --> 00:52:58,528
It's for our special accounts.

1119
00:52:58,615 --> 00:53:00,051
Its location is a secret even

1120
00:53:00,138 --> 00:53:01,835
for the owners themselves

1121

accounts, so they cannot be blackmailed.

1122
00:53:04,534 --> 00:53:06,753
Okay, so how do we get there?

1123
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,625
You walk on the sidewalk.

1124
00:53:08,712 --> 00:53:11,367
Well.

1125
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,369
You'll find another way to get there.

1126
00:53:15,022 --> 00:53:17,460
Please, I beg you.

1127
00:53:17,547 --> 00:53:18,765
Get out of this now while you still can.

1128
00:53:18,852 --> 00:53:21,768
I... have a family.

1129
00:53:21,855 --> 00:53:23,770
We... don't want to hurt you.

1130
00:53:23,857 --> 00:53:26,077
All we want is this woman's crypto account.

1131
00:53:26,164 --> 00:53:27,557
That's all.

1132
00:53:27,644 --> 00:53:29,776
You don't know who you're dealing with.

1133
00:53:29,863 --> 00:53:31,822
When you find out what is

1134
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:33,606
passing by, will kill everyone in this

1143
00:53:49,056 --> 00:53:50,797
Yeah.

1144
00:53:50,884 --> 00:53:53,452
And his lover is Isabelle Pharoah.

1146
00:54:01,591 --> 00:54:03,636
- We're dead. - [Shawn] I'm not following you.

1147
00:54:03,723 --> 00:54:05,638
It is a box of earth.

1148
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:07,597
It's... it's... it's that the most powerful people in the

1149
00:54:07,684 --> 00:54:10,208
world has its dirty little secrets in there.

1150
00:54:10,295 --> 00:54:11,818
And I tell you that it is the

1151
00:54:11,905 --> 00:54:14,299
most serious lever imaginable.

1152
00:54:16,345 --> 00:54:17,868
How do you know there's real dirt in there?

1153
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:20,653
Because nobody bothers to get to this level

1154
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:23,526
to hide things unless everything is fucked up.

1155
00:54:23,613 --> 00:54:27,094
And that-that decoy with the lover,

1156
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,705
I don't know why the hell they trusted this to

1157
00:54:28,792 --> 00:54:30,620
this guy, for God's sake. And look at this.

1158
00:54:30,707 --> 00:54:33,710
Our fan base is big, but not that big.

1159
00:54:33,797 --> 00:54:38,497
Oh man. If I'm wrong, we're dead.

1160
00:54:38,584 --> 00:54:41,718
And if I'm right, we make the decisions.

1161
00:54:43,023 --> 00:54:44,677
And we get the cryptography.

1162
00:54:44,764 --> 00:54:46,505
[Link] We will need the schematics.

1163
00:54:46,592 --> 00:54:47,767

00:54:47,854 --> 00:54:49,595

I'd like to talk to you.

1175
00:55:36,642 --> 00:55:38,209
So speak up.

1176
00:55:38,296 --> 00:55:39,471
Alone, please.

1177
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:43,562
I'll be right back.

1178
00:55:45,347 --> 00:55:46,957
Remember me again. Are you?

1179
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:50,395
Mr. Flores.

1180
00:55:50,482 --> 00:55:51,788
My client has an interest

00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:54,530
staff at this establishment

1182
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:56,793
in particular and well, he is worried.

1183
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,664
Who is your client?

1184
00:55:58,751 --> 00:56:00,840
Your superior knows who he is.

1185
00:56:00,927 --> 00:56:02,799
Well, no need to worry.

1186
00:56:02,886 --> 00:56:04,757
I have everything under control.

1187
00:56:04,844 --> 00:56:08,021
Is there a reason you haven't entered the building yet?

1188
00:56:08,108 --> 00:56:10,807
Yes, they have been returning hostages as planned.

1189
00:56:10,894 --> 00:56:13,331
No one has been hurt. I have no reason to do so.

1190
00:56:13,418 --> 00:56:16,029
My client's only concern is the safety of his property.

1191
00:56:16,116 --> 00:56:18,771
No one will leave that building

1192
00:56:18,858 --> 00:56:20,947
with the property of your client.

1193
00:56:21,034 --> 00:56:23,385
You may not understand the gist of this, Agent Decker.

1194
00:56:23,472 --> 00:56:25,212
Secure this establishment

1195
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:27,780
now or there will be an avalanche.

1196
00:56:27,867 --> 00:56:31,262
And as you know, avalanches are all about gravity.

1197
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:34,787
Either you get out of the way or you'll be buried alive.

1198

Why don't you call Agent Richter if you have to?

Ask him to give you a little more context.

1200

- Straight ahead. - Keep going, keep going.

Okay, it's plastic. What do you have?

1213
00:57:11,824 --> 00:57:13,870
- It's drywall. I've got my mallet. - Good.

Look, I bet you're glad I brought my gear now, huh?

1215

I'm very, very proud of you now. Now let's go.

- Okay, back off. - Okay.

I won't let you down, I promise.

[Anton] Hey boss, it's time for the hostages.

1227
00:58:06,444 --> 00:58:08,707
Shawn, take out your gun.

1228
00:58:08,794 --> 00:58:10,927
You get in the corner. Right now.

1229
00:58:11,014 --> 00:58:12,929
Now listen, it moves, you shoot it, dammit.

1230
00:58:13,016 --> 00:58:14,365

- Yes, boss. - I need two more.

1238

Who are the medicators?

1239
00:58:30,337 --> 00:58:31,382
You, come. Now.

Quick quick.

1243
00:58:40,173 --> 00:58:41,610
Okay, who's next on the list?

1244
00:58:41,697 --> 00:58:43,873
Two university students with their final exams.

1245
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,135
[Mason] All right, bring it. Bring it, bring it.

- Cojelos. - Come on. Come on.

1247
00:58:48,617 --> 00:58:49,661
Faster, move.

Two more come out.

1261
00:59:46,762 --> 00:59:49,591
- [Mason] Let's go. - Okay, I'm going, I'm going.

1262
00:59:51,114 --> 00:59:53,377
[men gasping]

1263
00:59:58,121 --> 00:59:58,991
Ah.

1264
01:00:00,036 --> 01:00:00,863
Ah.

1265
01:00:02,038 --> 01:00:03,256
Court.

1266
01:00:03,343 --> 01:00:06,999
[suspense music]

1267
01:00:07,086 --> 01:00:11,264
Look, you have to tell me something.

1268
01:00:11,351 --> 01:00:13,658
Who else have you ever talked to about this?

1269
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:18,358
Who told you about this job?

1270
01:00:18,445 --> 01:00:21,057
Remember my friend Al from Los Angeles?

1271
01:00:21,144 --> 01:00:23,581
He's a good guy. You've met him before.

1272
01:00:23,668 --> 01:00:27,629
Yeah, Al is the one who was in San Quentin 10 years ago, right?

1273
01:00:27,716 --> 01:00:30,719
Yeah, hey, it must have gone out.

1274
01:00:30,806 --> 01:00:32,721
Why are you questioning me about this?

1275
01:00:32,808 --> 01:00:36,420
[Mason] Oh, God, I have to make a call, keep digging.

1276
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,727
- [college girl] Hey, are you Decker? - Yeah.

1277
01:00:38,814 --> 01:00:39,597
Um, he asked me to give this to you.

1278
01:00:39,684 --> 01:00:41,338
He.

1279
01:00:41,425 --> 01:00:42,861
.

1280
01:00:42,948 --> 01:00:47,387
.

1281
01:00:47,474 --> 01:00:50,739
He said it was plan B.

1282
01:00:50,826 --> 01:00:52,262
Thanks. - [cell phone ringing] - Hey. Amy, I knew you were ruthless. But not this ruthless. What are you talking about?

1283
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:54,525
You used Al to get to my brother.

1284
01:00:54,612 --> 01:00:55,918
Alabama?

1285
01:00:56,005 --> 01:00:57,484
Yes, you got him out of prison early.

1286
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,443
Then he convinced my brother for this job.

1287
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,401
[Amy] That's not what's happening.

1288
01:01:01,488 --> 01:01:04,230
So why this box? Amy, this box.

1289
01:01:04,317 --> 01:01:05,405
Do you want us all to be killed?

1290
01:01:05,492 --> 01:01:07,930
No, of course not.

1291
01:01:08,017 --> 01:01:10,759
Mason, I've been honest with you all this time.

1292
01:01:10,846 --> 01:01:12,630
Oh really, how about Miami?

1293
01:01:12,717 --> 01:01:14,588
Was that real?

1294
01:01:14,676 --> 01:01:16,460
Yeah, I mean, most of it.

1295
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,984
Obviously it's not the work part, but the rest is.

1296
01:01:19,071 --> 01:01:20,725
[Mason] What about now?

1297
01:01:20,812 --> 01:01:23,119
[sigh] Mason, I swear,

1298
01:01:23,206 --> 01:01:26,122
I don't know anything about this box.

1299
01:01:26,209 --> 01:01:27,993
[Mason] Oh, don't you know, that this

1300
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,778
was it the box of Salazar's lover?

1301
01:01:29,865 --> 01:01:31,214
You didn't know?

1302
01:01:31,301 --> 01:01:32,998
[suspense music]

1303
01:01:33,085 --> 01:01:34,913
¿Abel Salazar?

1304
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,525
Yeah, yeah, you headed him straight to his litter box.

1305
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:40,397
[Amy] Okay, I'll have to call you back.

1306
01:01:40,484 --> 01:01:42,791
[suspense music]

1307
01:01:42,878 --> 01:01:44,531
Oh, fuck.

1308
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:47,273
-[phone ringing] -Decker.

1309
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,059
You set them up and used me to do it.

1310
01:01:50,146 --> 01:01:51,930
If I had told you everything,

1311
01:01:52,017 --> 01:01:53,497
would you have continued?

1312
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:55,455
No, no, of course not.

1313
01:01:55,542 --> 01:01:57,806
Exactly, I've already made my point clear.

1314
01:01:57,893 --> 01:01:59,285
What's in the box?

1315
01:02:01,244 --> 01:02:02,071
Wait.

1316
01:02:03,942 --> 01:02:06,423
[people chatting]

1317
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,340
I am not at liberty to disclose that.

1318
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:12,603
information at this time, but what you

1319
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:15,084
I can say that it is much bigger than you imagine.

1320
01:02:15,171 --> 01:02:16,563
Well, if this is so big,

1321
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:19,175
why don't we confiscate it?

1322
01:02:19,262 --> 01:02:21,177
[Decker] Salazar's lawyers are the best.

1323
01:02:21,264 --> 01:02:22,787
As soon as they had discovered that

1324
01:02:22,874 --> 01:02:24,093
We knew they would have blocked all the channels.

1325
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:26,617
legal and the box would have magically disappeared.

1326
01:02:26,704 --> 01:02:30,752
Vern, I was contacted by Salazar's liaison, Mr. Flowers.

1327
01:02:30,839 --> 01:02:33,711
They're not joking. They want to kill you all.

1328
01:02:33,798 --> 01:02:35,974
[Decker] Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

1329
01:02:36,061 --> 01:02:37,889
But can you shorten his leash a little?

1330
01:02:37,976 --> 01:02:39,586
Give me some time!

1331
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:41,501
Unfortunately, that time has passed.

1332
01:02:41,588 --> 01:02:43,286
Mr. Salazar has already slipped my mind.

1333
01:02:43,373 --> 01:02:44,983
How can this be?

1334
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:46,550
The fucking corrupt CIA.

1335
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,770
They have activated joint special operations.

1336
01:02:48,857 --> 01:02:51,511
By nightfall this will be under military jurisdiction.

01:03:13,272 --> 01:03:15,753
[Link] Straight ahead, follow the corridor for 20 meters.

1342
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,537
[Mason] Go straight.

[drill whirring]

01:04:30,523 --> 01:04:32,612
What do we have?

1362
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:34,440
It is a steel plate in the middle.

1363
01:04:34,527 --> 01:04:35,441
It will take some time to drill.

1364
01:04:35,528 --> 01:04:36,965
Can we use a C4?

1365
01:04:37,052 --> 01:04:38,618
No, no, that's too much attention.

1366
01:04:38,705 --> 01:04:39,968
Do you have the cobalt drill?

1367
01:04:40,055 --> 01:04:41,883
- Yes. - Use that.

What do you have?

1373
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:08,648
They're taking over, JSOC.

1374
01:05:08,735 --> 01:05:10,172
I can try to stop them, but

1375
01:05:10,259 --> 01:05:12,174
Salazar ignored everyone.

1376
01:05:13,001 --> 01:05:15,003
Special ops, huh?

1377
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:17,527
[Amy] Yes, but it's not worth losing your life over.

1378
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:19,137
I mean, give yourself up while

1379
01:05:19,224 --> 01:05:21,009
I still have the power to protect you.

1380
01:05:21,096 --> 01:05:24,795
Let me be your plan B, be smart.

1381
01:05:24,882 --> 01:05:27,319
When have I ever been smart?

1382
01:05:27,406 --> 01:05:30,714
Just let me know how I can help you.

1383
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:35,240
You can reach out to all your media friends, make them sweat.

1384
01:05:35,327 --> 01:05:37,460
I can try. I mean, it will take some time.

1385
01:05:37,547 --> 01:05:39,462
I... can't make any promises.

1386
01:05:39,549 --> 01:05:41,203

¿Mason?

Commander Cyrus, JSOC.

1391
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:14,410
Commander Cyrus, they are still releasing hostages.

1392
01:06:14,497 --> 01:06:16,194
This has been a peaceful transaction.

1393
01:06:16,281 --> 01:06:18,022
The FBI has surrendered its authority and is

1394
01:06:18,109 --> 01:06:21,983
operation is now under my jurisdiction.

1395
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:25,595
Rest assured, I should have this finished within an hour.

1396
01:06:25,682 --> 01:06:26,944
Connect me to the bank's main line.

1397
01:06:27,031 --> 01:06:29,033
[JSOC Operator] You got it, sir.

1398
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,861
You're welcome to stay, but just get out of our way.

My name is Ciro, Special Operations Commander.

1404
01:06:53,144 --> 01:06:55,755
Conciliation is no longer an option and the

1405
01:06:55,842 --> 01:06:59,542
Negotiations have ended. Am I making myself clear?

1406
01:06:59,629 --> 01:07:03,198
Special Ops, wow, we really hit a nerve here, didn't we?

1407
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:05,765
You are going to free the remaining hostages.

1408
01:07:05,852 --> 01:07:07,767
They will leave the bank in a single file.

1409
01:07:07,854 --> 01:07:09,726
And every time I give the signal,

1410
01:07:09,813 --> 01:07:13,599
You and your crew will follow me.

01:07:13,686 --> 01:07:15,427
hands in the air. Hands in the air?

1412
01:07:15,514 --> 01:07:18,256
Well, how are we supposed to put our hands in the air?

1413
01:07:18,343 --> 01:07:20,737
and- and push a- A wheelbarrow?

1414

Forklift truck?

1415
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:24,262
[Mason] Yeah, a wheelbarrow full of all the-

1416
01:07:24,349 --> 01:07:27,483
the land we found.

1417
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:29,137
That's why you're here, isn't it?

1418
01:07:29,224 --> 01:07:31,965
because Salazar pulled some strings?

1419
01:07:32,053 --> 01:07:36,100
Leave everything in the bank

1420
01:07:36,187 --> 01:07:38,233
exactly where you found it.

1421
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,236
Exactly 15 minutes from the second in which

1422
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:44,630
end this call, we arrived with extreme prejudice.

1423
01:07:44,717 --> 01:07:46,458
Okay, I'm not the smartest guy in the world,

1424
01:07:46,545 --> 01:07:50,114
but I know a threat when I hear one.

1425
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:52,029
So this is my answer to you.

1426
01:07:52,116 --> 01:07:54,466
Okay, do you have a pen?

1427
01:07:54,553 --> 01:07:56,860
Okay, well, son, are you listening?

1428
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:59,819
Okay, okay, first word, fuck.

1429
01:07:59,906 --> 01:08:01,299
Second word, you.

1430
01:08:02,605 --> 01:08:04,302
You will regret it.

1431
01:08:04,389 --> 01:08:07,088
Not as much as Salazar. Check your six o'clock.
