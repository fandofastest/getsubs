1
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,660
A long time ago, in an era where
there was no concept of 'shinobi',

2
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,660
in an attempt to end an era of violence,

3
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,660
a certain someone ate a forbidden fruit

4
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,660
and gained the power of chakra.

5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,660
However, as time passed, they
became obsessed with that power.

6
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,100
To bring justice to the world,
what is it that we need?

7
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,660
Power or love?

8
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,160
This question would start an arduous war...

9
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,660
which has continued throughout the generations.

10
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,660
Hey, if you're a Hyuga show us your Byakugan!

11
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,500
If you can't don't show your face around here!

12
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,760
Your eyes are really creepy.

13
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,460
I bet you're actually a monster, right?

14
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,300
You Byakugan monster!

15
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,160
Hey, stop it!

16
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,170
What's your problem?

17
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,160
I'm Uzumaki Naruto!

18
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,460
I'm the future hokage!

19
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,420
The 'future hokage'?

20
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,040
Are you some kind of moron?

21
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,160
Prepare yourself! Kagebunshin no jutsu!

22
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,660
I'm going to beat you!

23
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,660
Me too!

24
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,660
Take that!

25
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,660
We really taught this guy a lesson!

26
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,510
What's up with this "future hokage"?

27
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:17,660
For being so cocky, let's take care of his red scarf!

28
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,660
It's not over yet! This time I will
bet on an awesome jutsu!

29
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,660
Are you okay?

30
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,660
It's nothing.

31
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,040
Your scarf.  Those boys they--

32
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,660
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,510
Don't worry about it.

34
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,390
Wait...

35
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,660
Thank you so much.

36
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,660
See you!

37
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,420
If the world were to end tomorrow,

38
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,660
who would you like to spend your last day with?

39
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,820
Like that would ever happen.

40
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,660
Just suppose...

41
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,720
The moon began to fall.

42
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,840
If it's the end of the world,

43
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,660
I wish meat would fall instead of the moon!

44
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,420
If the moon started falling, I would protect you.

45
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,800
Like I would ever want <i>you</i>  to protect me.

46
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,900
Write down who you'd want to
spend your last day on Earth with.

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,730
That's impossible...

48
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,290
I don't have a Dad or a Mom

49
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,470
or any friends.

50
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,880
Hey, Naruto!

51
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,660
Don't throw away your paper!

52
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,490
But there's no way the world is gonna end!

53
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,850
I'm not saying it will, I'm just saying <i>if</i>  it does!

54
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,420
Well, it ain't gonna happen.

55
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,710
This is a celestial decree

56
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,280
upon the Hyuga clan.

57
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,470
I will ask you one last time.

58
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,900
Let me hear your answer, Hyuga Hiashi.

59
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,500
The answer, which will decide
the future of your clan.

60
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,710
This is the Hyuga's...

61
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,750
...reply!

62
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,600
How foolish.

63
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,880
Today I'm your special
coach, so pay attention!

64
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,250
Naruto-senpai!

65
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,970
I never expected him to become
such high stakes material.

66
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,840
You say 'steak'?

67
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,840
'High stakes' as in popular with girls.

68
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,690
His efforts in the war two years ago

69
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,860
turned him into the village hero after all.

70
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,940
Yeah.

71
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,810
Thank you very much.

72
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,240
All right, eat your fill.

73
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,420
Thanks for the food!

74
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,840
Naruto-niichan!

75
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,870
Oh, Konohamaru?

76
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,050
I have something to show you.

77
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,850
What is it?

78
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,050
It's grandfather Hiruzen's stuff.

79
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,070
I found it all during spring cleaning.

80
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,740
Hey, is this...?

81
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,750
Don't you dare call it junk.

82
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,840
They're very precious.

83
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,700
These are...?

84
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,300
They're not junk okay?!

85
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,200
I'm Uzumaki Naruto!

86
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:54,130
{\an8}RINNE FESTIVAL

87
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,760
Time sure flies...

88
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,870
sales for the Festival Rinne
have already started.

89
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,280
Naruto-senpai!

90
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,280
Please accept my Rinne Festival present.

91
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,810
For me?

92
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,550
I'm always cheering for you!

93
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,080
I made it myself!

94
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,260
Please accept it!

95
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,480
T-thank you.

96
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,010
Thank you very much.

97
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,400
Hinata!

98
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,830
Oh, Sakura-san.

99
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,510
Knitting something?

100
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,580
That's a surprise.

101
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,850
I'm making a scarf.

102
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,550
W-what is it?

103
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,260
Give it your all, okay?

104
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,610
It's a present for him, right?

105
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,050
He's become really popular lately.

106
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,770
Oh, really?

107
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,200
People even come all the way from other villages

108
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,180
just to take pictures of him.

109
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,440
Oh...

110
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,060
Don't just say 'Oh'.

111
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,370
Hurry up and finish that scarf.

112
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,570
O-okay.

113
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,350
Come on,

114
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,530
you should have more confidence.

115
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,720
Be bold!

116
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,820
O-okay.

117
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,960
It looks quite big, doesn't it?

118
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,840
All done!

119
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,050
I put my heart and soul into it.

120
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,350
I'm sure my feelings will reach Naruto-kun.

121
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,670
But will they?

122
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,890
It's already late.

123
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,770
Maybe tomorrow would be better?

124
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,970
No! I'll give it to him tonight.

125
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,930
Or maybe tomorrow...

126
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,070
No, tonight.

127
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,720
Or maybe tomorrow...

128
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,570
Why don't you just hurry up and
tell him how you feel already?

129
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,880
Hanabi!

130
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,300
If you were there all along why didn't you say so?!

131
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,320
Watching a girl agonize over love is more fun.

132
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,980
That's no way for a child to talk.

133
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,700
I'm not a child,

134
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,770
my Byakugan's perception is
as good as any grown up!

135
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,480
Anyway, look!

136
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,240
Isn't it cute?

137
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
Treating your kunai like a toy again.

138
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,050
He'll burst out laughing if your tummy
growls while you're confessing your love.

139
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,000
Who said I was going to confess anything?!

140
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,500
Rather than giving him a scarf,

141
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,200
maybe you should try dressing
a bit more fashionably?

142
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,430
Are you saying that the moon is falling?

143
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,460
The moon is clearly getting closer to Earth.

144
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,110
Is that why there have been
more meteorites lately?

145
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,200
I'll explain...

146
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,700
As the two celestial bodies get closer to each other,

147
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,990
their gravitational pull on each other increases.

148
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,090
Once they come within a certain distance,

149
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,400
The moon's surface will begin to break apart.

150
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,740
I believe a part of the moon's
surface has begun to fall to Earth.

151
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,050
And what will happen?

152
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,240
The moon will completely disintegrate,

153
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,080
and its fragments will rain over the Earth's surface.

154
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,480
If nothing is done, mankind will surely...

155
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,210
Be wiped out, right?

156
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,480
Is this a natural phenomenon?

157
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,080
Or is this a man-made assault?

158
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,760
That is a good question.

159
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,290
It's getting to to that time of year
when ramen really hits the spot.

160
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,560
You only ever eat ramen all year long.

161
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,550
You really like ramen, don't you?

162
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,530
Yup, I love it.

163
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,130
Five more orders of gyoza.

164
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,950
Coming up!

165
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,030
Five orders?!

166
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,660
I can't eat five more orders.

167
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,370
Then don't have any.

168
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,040
Time to eat.

169
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,420
Oh... Can't get this dirty.

170
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,820
Hey, that scarf--

171
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,640
Oh, Hinata.

172
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,900
Join us if you haven't eaten.

173
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,860
It's on me tonight!

174
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,100
He said something made him
happy and he wants to celebrate.

175
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,660
B-but...

176
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,160
Don't be shy, come and sit here.

177
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,530
Join us, Hinata.

178
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,020
O-okay.

179
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,610
Naruto-senpai!

180
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,680
Hey, it's you guys.

181
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,840
Thanks for the presents the other day.

182
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,740
Order whatever you want,

183
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,820
it's my treat as thanks for the presents.

184
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,330
Thank you so much!

185
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,020
Hinata, you can order whatever you want too.

186
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,930
Over here, Senpai!

187
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,750
Let's eat together!

188
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,530
Hinata...?

189
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,990
What's wrong?

190
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,910
I'm sorry. Actually, I'm quite full.

191
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,520
Hinata!

192
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,620
Walk her home.

193
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,060
Walk Hinata home?

194
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,640
Why?

195
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,460
Well...

196
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,530
You can't let a young girl walk home alone at night.

197
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,500
Order ready!

198
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,530
Coming!

199
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,010
Hinata's really strong,

200
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,440
no one in the village would dare mess with her.

201
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,670
Hinata!

202
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,430
Oh, you're such an idiot!

203
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,870
Why are you calling me an idiot?

204
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,220
Senpai, the gyoza are ready.

205
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,360
Let's eat!

206
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,740
He can be so dense.

207
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,890
You were going to give him the scarf weren't you?

208
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,440
Yeah.

209
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,090
You can do it, Hinata. Be confident!

210
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,340
Thanks.

211
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,440
But how come you're encouraging me so much?

212
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,480
Well...

213
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,050
Let's both do our best!

214
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,700
Both of us?

215
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,610
Who's there?

216
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,300
Hanabi-chan?

217
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,410
Super Beast Scroll!

218
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,010
Naruto-kun...

219
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,950
I've always gazed at you from afar.

220
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,400
But from now on, I want to always,

221
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,040
always stand by your side.

222
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,190
So I knitted this with all my heart...

223
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,660
Please, accept my feelings.

224
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,340
All right, one more time.

225
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
Naruto-kun...

226
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,070
Hinata!

227
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,060
Good evening.

228
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,550
We saw each other earlier at Ichiraku.

229
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,480
Oh, that's right!

230
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,250
What's the matter?

231
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,640
Th-that's a nice scarf.

232
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,030
Oh, yeah.

233
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,480
Hey, it sounds like you're hungry.

234
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,190
If you don't mind instant ramen,
I have some in my room.

235
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,140
Good night!

236
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,720
Didn't you want to talk to me?

237
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,560
Hey, Hinata!

238
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,090
I wonder who gave it to him?

239
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,190
I'm happy for you, Naruto-kun.

240
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,580
Why are you crying?

241
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,450
You're getting the scarf wet.

242
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,710
I don't need it anymore.

243
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,380
Then, I'll take it.

244
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,310
Who are you?

245
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:56,420
I'm Toneri. I've come to retrieve you.

246
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,160
'Retrieve' me?

247
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,100
Hinata!

248
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,940
What are you...? Let me go!

249
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,970
Hey, you, what are you doing to Hinata?

250
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,550
Tajuu Kagebunshin no jutsu!

251
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
Hinata!

252
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,260
Rasen Shuriken!

253
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,200
Hey you... Give Hinata back!

254
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
Hold it!

255
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,190
Hinata, are you okay?

256
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,690
Yeah!

257
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,950
Rasengan!

258
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,240
My body is going numb.

259
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,660
My strength...

260
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,080
Hinata!

261
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,480
Your scarf is ruined.

262
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
Yes...

263
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,790
Where did those Shinobi come from?

264
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,670
I don't know.

265
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,920
The final day is approaching.

266
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,040
Before that...

267
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,950
You bastard.

268
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,220
Before that day, I will come for you.

269
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Hinata.

270
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,440
What is that?

271
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,020
W-what's going on?

272
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,060
The Earth...

273
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,750
will be destroyed soon.

274
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,210
Your mission is to

275
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,010
rescue Hyuga Hanabi who has been kidnapped.

276
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,680
You'll be working as a four
man team led by Shikamaru.

277
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,700
I'm also granting Hinata's request
to be included in this team.

278
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,460
Thank you very much.

279
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,120
Shikamaru, put your hand out.

280
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,510
Why?

281
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,260
What is this?

282
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,530
A top secret device that only the Five Kage possess.

283
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,800
What kind of device is it?

284
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,810
It's counting down the time until Earth's destruction.

285
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,680
I don't get it.

286
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,660
Why is this necessary for Hanabi's rescue?

287
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,660
Toneri, the one who kidnapped Hanabi,

288
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,720
could be the one manipulating the moon.

289
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,430
What are you basing this on?

290
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,740
My intuition.

291
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,040
It was around here

292
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,190
that I lost sight of Hanabi-chan's kidnapper.

293
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,890
Let's split up and search for clues.

294
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,860
Naruto, take care of Hinata.

295
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,990
Leave it to me!

296
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,540
What is it?

297
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,730
Oh, nothing.

298
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,110
What is it?

299
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,240
It's Hanabi's kunai.

300
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,950
You brought the scarf?

301
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,480
Why aren't you using it? Aren't you cold?

302
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,170
I-I'm fine.

303
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:58,000
Anyway, we'd better hurry up and let
Shikamaru-kun and the others know.

304
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,580
Oh yeah, you're right.

305
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,950
What do you see, Hinata?

306
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,000
There's a spring that's glowing
at the bottom of the cave.

307
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,810
A spring that's glowing?

308
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,530
That Shinobi letter is 'A' as in 'Aun'.

309
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,930
It could mean 'This is the beginning'.

310
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,020
Hinata, what can you see
at the bottom of the spring?

311
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,890
My vision is distorted.

312
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,970
Your Byakugan is distorting?

313
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,250
We'll just have to go down and see.

314
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,260
I can't get this wet.

315
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,770
You're being so particular.

316
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,330
What's the big deal if your scarf gets wet?

317
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,990
It's a big deal. This means a lot to me.

318
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,880
There's no need to worry.

319
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:44,410
I touched the water and didn't get wet.

320
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:18,170
If the world were to end tomorrow,

321
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,180
who would you like to
spend your last day with?

322
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,150
Like that would ever happen.

323
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,730
Just suppose...

324
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,620
The moon began to fall.

325
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,880
If it's the end of the world,

326
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,720
I wish meat would fall instead of the moon!

327
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,000
Look, the moon.

328
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,970
The match up for the round seven...

329
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,690
Uzumaki Naruto vs.

330
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,200
Inuzuka Kiba.

331
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,260
This is the chunin exam.

332
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,460
Naruto!

333
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,840
Don't you dare lose to a guy like him!

334
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,200
Ninja Art Beast Mimicry: All-Fours jutsu.

335
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,880
Wait a minute!

336
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,060
Here I come.

337
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,090
Stop it, Kiba.

338
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,180
Naruto-kun is fighting Pain right now.

339
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,750
Naruto-kun is fighting alone.

340
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,810
Banshō Ten'in.

341
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,660
Naruto...

342
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,920
Naruto...

343
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,760
What is it?

344
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,400
It's ointment.

345
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,560
Why are you giving this to me?

346
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,690
Just accept it, Naruto.

347
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,570
Thanks, you're a nice person Hinata.

348
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Banshō Ten'in.

349
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,460
Soon I will take you with me.

350
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,880
Why'd you come out here?!

351
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,510
You're no match for him.

352
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,080
This time,

353
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,140
I'm going to save you, Naruto-kun.

354
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,070
I was always crying, and
giving up before even trying.

355
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,510
I made so many wrong turns.

356
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:48,920
But Naruto-kun, you helped me find
my way and take the correct path..

357
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,080
I always chased after you,

358
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,760
I wanted to catch up to you,

359
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,410
I wanted to walk beside you all the time.

360
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,710
I want to be at your side, always.

361
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:05,160
You changed me, Naruto-kun.

362
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,820
Your smile is what saved me.

363
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,850
That's why I'm not afraid to die,

364
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,510
if it means I can protect you!

365
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:26,500
That's because I love you, Naruto-kun.

366
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,170
Hinata...

367
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:36,100
If the world were to end tomorrow,

368
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,950
who would you like to
spend your last day with?

369
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,000
If it's the end of the world,

370
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,640
I wish meat would fall instead of the moon!

371
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,490
It's Iruka-sensei again, huh?

372
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:55,110
Write down who you'd want to
spend your last day on Earth with.

373
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,600
Hey, Naruto!

374
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,230
Don't throw away your paper!

375
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,180
But there's no way the world's gonna end.

376
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,170
I'm not saying it will,
I'm just saying <i>if</i>  it does!

377
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,420
Well, it ain't gonna happen.

378
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,230
{\an8}Uzumaki Naruto.

379
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,970
Me?

380
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,560
Naruto-kun...

381
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,620
What is it?

382
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,010
It's ointment.

383
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,590
Why are you giving this to me?

384
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,310
So dense.

385
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,440
He can be so dense.

386
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:41,930
You were going to give him
the scarf, weren't you?

387
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,760
Yeah.

388
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,770
You can do it, Hinata.

389
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,690
Be confident!

390
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,500
Thanks.

391
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,310
Naruto-kun, I-

392
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,260
You really love Ramen, don't you?

393
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,180
Yup, I love it.

394
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,890
Naruto-kun, I-

395
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,420
Like, really love it.

396
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:04,200
Yup, like that time Hinata said she loved me.

397
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,000
He's so dense.

398
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,970
Maybe he doesn't know what love is?

399
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,080
What do you mean?

400
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,500
Like, knowing the difference between loving sweets like
Shiratama dumplings or fruit gelatin and romantic love.

401
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,020
They aren't the same?

402
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:23,350
Hinata! Oh, you're such an idiot...

403
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,310
Why'd you call me an idiot?

404
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,680
Senpai, the gyoza are ready.

405
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,660
Let's eat.

406
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,380
Hinata!

407
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,160
Senpai.

408
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,810
Hinata!

409
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,100
{\an8}Uzumaki Naruto.

410
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,220
Hinata...

411
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,880
That's why I'm not afraid to die,

412
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,490
if it means I can protect you.

413
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,800
Because,

414
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,330
I love you, Naruto-kun.

415
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
Hinata...

416
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,180
Naruto!

417
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,630
Wake up!

418
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,880
This is a dream!

419
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,330
Oh, Sakura-chan.

420
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,300
You're finally awake.

421
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,640
Is this a trap set by the enemy?

422
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,550
Yeah, it traps intruders in a genjutsu,

423
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,800
and locks them away in a world of memories.

424
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,860
It's a prison of caged memories.

425
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,550
Thankfully Sakura who's
resistant to genjutsu was with us.

426
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,660
Thanks, Sakura.

427
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,650
I was having a fun dream of my brother.

428
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,420
I appreciate you ripping me away from it.

429
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,330
That doesn't sound like gratitude.

430
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,610
Another spring?

431
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,800
Your Byakugan doesn't
work here either, right?

432
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,820
No, my sight is distorted.

433
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,990
All right. As we proceed
be prepared to fight.

434
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,120
Roger.

435
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,430
What's the matter?

436
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,540
About those genjutsu dreams earlier...

437
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,990
What is it?

438
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,600
No, never mind.

439
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,090
Hinata...

440
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,810
I said I'd come for you.

441
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,610
But I never thought you come to me.

442
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,840
Where is Hanabi?

443
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,640
Don't worry, she's fast asleep in my castle.

444
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,550
Return Hanabi!

445
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,020
That will all depend on your answer...

446
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,170
Byakugan Princess.

447
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,600
'Byakugan Princess'?

448
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,510
Hinata...

449
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,200
I...

450
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,510
...want you to marry me.

451
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,060
Marry you...?

452
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,800
It's like a bubble factory.

453
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,110
I get it.

454
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,680
This is where the gatekeeper
who made the bubbles lives.

455
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,650
Gatekeeper?

456
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,300
Naruto and Hinata are taking their time...

457
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,100
We should go back to check--

458
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,640
A crab!?!

459
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,220
That's the gatekeeper.

460
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,610
Hinata!

461
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,760
Naruto-kun!

462
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,310
Get away from Hinata!

463
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,700
You again? You're in my way.

464
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,330
Move.

465
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,970
Where is Hanabi?

466
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,980
Spread out!

467
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,870
Don't destroy the bubbles,

468
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,950
or we'll get caught in that genjutsu again!

469
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,050
Super Beast Scroll!

470
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,170
Fujin, Raijin!

471
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,360
Perfect!

472
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,080
Shadow Stitching!

473
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:58,930
Sakura!

474
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,880
Damn it!

475
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,410
You're a puppet aren't you?

476
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,680
This is not my body.

477
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,390
Hinata...

478
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,040
Next time, the real me will come for you.

479
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,730
Give me an answer then.

480
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,970
Shut the hell up!

481
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:04,930
Your fists won't ever touch me.

482
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:05,930
Not even close.

483
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,790
Did you do this with a single punch, Sakura-chan?

484
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Of couse.

485
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,290
Naruto, if you leave Hinata behind
and expose her to danger again,

486
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,920
you'll get a taste of my fists too.

487
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,630
I know.

488
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,330
Hinata, I'll never let--

489
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,140
I'll not let you out of my sight again.

490
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,860
What is that?

491
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,750
You're already looking away!

492
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,310
I'm not looking away!

493
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,910
What is this place?

494
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,350
Is that island floting?

495
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,370
No.

496
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,930
The surface of the oceans is warped.

497
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,020
There's sunlight underground too.

498
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,220
Isn't that artificial?

499
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,750
A man-made sun?

500
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,920
Yeah.

501
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,600
Hinata, any sign of the enemy?

502
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,080
No, we're fine.

503
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,750
The enemy is aware of us.

504
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,330
Why aren't they attacking?

505
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,890
Yeah, that bothers me too.

506
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,240
It's too quiet.

507
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,800
Leave them be.

508
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,730
Don't do anything until I go to get her.

509
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,770
The eyes are twitching again!

510
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,500
Exquisite...

511
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,040
This Byakugan is very pure.

512
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,200
Hinata?

513
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,280
That scarf... It was really for me?

514
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,730
I see a town about twenty kilometers ahead.

515
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,020
All right, let's go.

516
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,820
It seems like it's deserted.

517
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,710
This town was built a few centuries ago.

518
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,250
Let's split up and search.

519
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,880
So it was a Shinobi village.

520
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,900
A fire?

521
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,050
What is this?

522
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,280
Was there a war here long ago?

523
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,350
What's wrong, Hinata?

524
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,370
There's a spider web.

525
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,710
You can see so much with your Byakugan,

526
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,880
yet you walk straight into a spider web.

527
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,330
You're a silly one, huh?

528
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,620
Naruto-kun...

529
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,780
What is it?

530
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,250
Where is your scarf?

531
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,240
It was pretty warm underground, so I took it off.

532
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,800
I-I see.

533
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,420
I feel a bit cold myself.

534
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:49,820
Well of course you are,
dressed in clothing like that.

535
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,170
It's just that this is my mission gear!

536
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,880
If you can take it,

537
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,170
I can handle a little cold like this.

538
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,330
Are you okay?

539
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,020
I'm totally fine.

540
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,350
What?

541
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,880
It's nothing.

542
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,970
What is it?

543
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,130
I said it's nothing!

544
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,660
Come on, tell me.

545
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,810
That was good.

546
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,460
Are you going somewhere?

547
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,820
I'm gonna take a leak.

548
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,930
Naruto-kun?!

549
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,880
A spider web.

550
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,910
You okay?

551
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,800
Yeah.

552
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,800
Ouch!

553
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,020
What's wrong?

554
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,370
I think I hurt my back.

555
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:49,860
Here you go.

556
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,170
Thanks.

557
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,150
Oh, yeah.

558
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,370
You gave me some ointment back
during the Chunin exams, right?

559
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,460
You remembered that after all this time?

560
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,380
Actually, I only just remembered it.

561
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,170
Thanks.

562
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,080
We have to hurry and rescue Hanabi.

563
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,670
Naruto-kun, I'd like to talk
to you about something...

564
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:44,810
What is it?

565
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,090
About what was said when
that Toneri puppet appeared.

566
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,720
Toneri?

567
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,920
Here they are!

568
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,080
Hinata, we need you to check something.

569
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,510
What does it say?

570
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,690
It's some ancient writings.

571
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,020
'An ancient oath

572
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,660
crossing the path of humanity.

573
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,730
Like all else,

574
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:10,640
the Fist of the Tensei eye, the reborn moon,

575
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,820
will destroy man'.

576
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,210
What does that mean?

577
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,510
Maybe this 'Tensei eye'
is making the moon move?

578
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,300
Maybe Hanabi's abduction
is connected to the moon,

579
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,620
Just like Kakashi-sensei said.

580
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:25,420
Well, his hunches are always spot on...

581
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,420
Unfortunately.

582
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,500
Byakugan Princess!

583
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:32,650
What is that?

584
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:50,020
Is this a cemetery?

585
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,420
What is this?

586
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,290
Someone's here!

587
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:02,240
Byakugan... I sense the Byakugan.

588
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,110
Oh, I'm certain of it!

589
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,950
Oh, Byakugan Princess.

590
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,330
Stay away from Hinata!

591
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:38,570
Hinata!

592
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,130
What did you do to Hinata?!

593
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:47,260
The Tenseigan has been revived.

594
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,880
It must be stopped.

595
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,370
Otsutsuki's...

596
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,000
Hinata, are you all right?

597
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,350
Y-yes.

598
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,140
That man said something like 'Otsutsuki'...

599
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,980
That's the original surname
of the Sage of Six Paths.

600
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,310
Otsutsuki Hagoromo...

601
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,170
That was the name of Sage of the Six Paths

602
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,020
before he entered the priesthood.

603
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,550
He called Hinata 'Byakugan Princess'.

604
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,950
Seems Toneri's abduction
of Hanabi is connected.

605
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:30,280
Knitting again...

606
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:33,140
Is she going to keep knitting forever?

607
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,290
I guess it takes a lot of time.

608
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,910
Hinata, what was it that you
wanted to talk about earlier?

609
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:46,940
You mentioned something about
what Toneri's puppet said?

610
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,640
Oh, that. It was nothing.

611
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,200
What do you mean nothing?

612
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:59,510
I'm sorry, I'd like to be alone.

613
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:05,870
I see.

614
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,460
Let's check out that village.

615
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,600
Seems like Hanabi's not here either.

616
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,730
We should head back and rejoin the others.

617
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,500
Yeah.

618
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,060
Hinata.

619
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,040
My little sister is in so much danger,

620
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,450
and here I am knitting.

621
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:12,600
I'm a terrible big sister, aren't I?

622
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,840
That's not true,

623
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,980
you came all this way to
save your sister, didn't you?

624
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,200
If only I'd stayed home that night--

625
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,700
I swear I'll rescue Hanabi!

626
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,530
You don't need to worry.

627
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,420
Thank you.

628
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,410
You're so kind, Naruto-kun.

629
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,400
Well, I'm not being kind just because
I'm in love with you or anything.

630
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,720
I'm just worried about Hanabi.

631
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,360
What was that?

632
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,130
What did you just say?

633
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:49,660
I'm worried about Hanabi.

634
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,550
Before that...

635
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,300
Before that...?

636
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:02,730
Hinata...

637
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,240
I...

638
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,240
I love you.

639
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,370
Hinata?

640
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,800
Toneri, are you another puppet?

641
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:50,820
Where is Hanabi?

642
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,830
Silence.

643
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:54,680
I came to hear Hinata's answer.

644
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,480
Answer? Hinata has nothing to say to you.

645
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:00,150
So where is Hanabi?

646
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:03,000
Hinata.

647
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,600
Hey!

648
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:10,840
Hinata what's going on?

649
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,130
Naruto-kun...

650
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,400
goodbye.

651
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,310
Hinata!

652
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,170
Give Hinata back!

653
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,840
'Give her back'?

654
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,520
Hinata came to me willingly.

655
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,580
This has been destined since ancient times.

656
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,800
Hinata and I shall be wed.

657
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,150
Wed?

658
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:25,110
Hinata...

659
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,280
That's a lie, right?

660
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,730
My chakra is...

661
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,420
What are you doing?!

662
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,600
I didn't want to get into a petty fight

663
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,200
and risk getting you hurt.

664
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,330
Hinata...

665
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,260
Hurry up and move forward!

666
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,660
I can't go any further!

667
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,220
Hey, stay in the line!

668
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,420
Don't panic!

669
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,600
The Air-raid shelters were constructed

670
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,400
to accommodate every
citizen in the Land of Fire.

671
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,240
Keep calm. Please keep calm.

672
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,370
Water Style: Water Dragon jutsu.

673
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:39,220
Lava style: Lava Monster jutsu.

674
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,110
Particle Style: Atomic Dismantling jutsu.

675
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:53,640
Damn it, my back!

676
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,550
So this place is the moon?

677
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:04,420
Yeah.

678
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:06,730
That place we encountered the
crab bubbles may be a conduit.

679
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:10,200
A passageway connecting
the Earth to the moon.

680
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:15,080
How is Naruto doing?

681
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,200
It's bad.

682
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:18,590
He's been almost completely drained of chakra.

683
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:24,000
Hinata...

684
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:29,710
So you finally get it, you blockhead.

685
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,620
So beautiful...

686
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:41,860
Hinata, I want to know more about you.

687
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,770
Why this guy...?

688
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:00,710
This place is...

689
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,680
Toneri's castle?

690
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,530
Hanabi!

691
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,370
Her eyes have been removed.

692
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,270
Hinata...

693
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:40,190
I...

694
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,270
...want you to marry me.

695
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:44,750
Marry you...?

696
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:46,400
What are you saying?!

697
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,200
Let Hanabi--

698
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,100
Your sister is in my castle.

699
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,570
Hanabi!

700
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,830
I've taken her Byakugan for my own.

701
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,800
You're terrible.

702
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,480
I'm sorry.

703
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,700
It's all part of Hamura's celestial decree.

704
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:06,870
Hamura?

705
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:10,340
The founder of the Shinobi of
the Moon, Otsutsuki Hamura.

706
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:12,700
Perhaps you will understand if I said he was

707
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:16,780
the younger brother of The Sage of the Six Paths.
Founder of the Shinobi of Earth.

708
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:20,490
Your Hyuga clan are inheritors
of Hamura's bloodline.

709
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,490
The story goes back many eons.
Several millennia, in fact.

710
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:30,460
The Sage of the Six Paths,
the elder brother, had some misgivings.

711
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,160
He feared that the Ten Tails,

712
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,150
with its massive chakra
and immeasurable power,

713
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:38,830
would bring calamity to the world.

714
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:43,880
So The Sage of the Six Paths
extracted the Ten Tail's chakra

715
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,570
and divided it among nine tailed
beasts in order to weaken its power.

716
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,710
The husk of the Ten Tails
whose chakra was extracted,

717
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:53,790
namely the Gedo Statue,
was hidden and sealed away on the moon.

718
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:57,880
In order to prevent the
Ten Tails from being revived,

719
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:01,350
Hamura decided to live on the moon

720
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:03,250
and guard the Gedo Statue.

721
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:07,860
The Sage of the Six Paths however,
became the founder of the Shinobi on Earth.

722
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:12,400
But Hamura was skeptical of the world that his

723
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,340
older brother was creating.

724
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:20,140
He decided that if the world created by his
brother went astray from the path of Shinobi,

725
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:23,820
He would entrust his descendants
with ensuring its destruction.

726
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:28,170
Throughout the millennia that have passed,

727
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,710
fighting between the Shinobi
on Earth has not ceased.

728
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,360
They continue to use chakra as a weapon,

729
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:37,130
and ultimately, even
the Gedo Statue was stolen

730
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:38,890
and the Ten Tails was revived.

731
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:42,820
Our clan then reached the conclusion

732
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:46,680
that the Shinobi of Earth only serve
to destroy the world's peace and order.

733
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:51,030
The world that The Sage of the Six Paths
created was deemed a failure.

734
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,020
So in accordance with the celestial decree of Hamura,

735
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,860
I will destroy the world made
by The Sage of the Six Paths.

736
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:04,250
When this pure Byakugan
synergizes with my chakra,

737
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,200
it will transform into the Tenseigan.

738
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,340
With its visual prowess I will
gather up the ashes of the Earth

739
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,710
and create a completely new world.

740
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,540
I don't believe your story,

741
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,440
and I'm going to rescue Hanabi!

742
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:20,240
Despite having no notion of
where this castle is located?

743
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,220
I'll return for your answer.

744
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:28,290
Hinata!

745
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,800
Good morning.

746
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:43,640
I'm happy that you accepted my feelings, Hinata.

747
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:51,440
Hinata-sama, welcome to the castle.

748
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,730
Welcome.

749
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,130
There are only puppets in this castle, then?

750
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:58,800
They're marionettes left here by our ancestors.

751
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:02,000
Since my father died when I was young,

752
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:05,710
I have lived alone in the castle.

753
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,170
We will hold the marriage ceremony here.

754
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:14,550
Then we will enter the Room of Rebirth

755
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:16,350
and fall into a deep slumber

756
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:19,260
until the Earth stabilizes after its destruction.

757
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,400
That's impossible.

758
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:22,440
The moon will also be destroyed!

759
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,520
Don't worry. This castle is
protected by an immense chakra.

760
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:28,380
An immense chakra?

761
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,750
Yes, strong enough to move the moon.

762
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:31,980
What do you mean?

763
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,330
It's the power of Otsutsuki's treasure,

764
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:37,680
honed from the suffering of my clan.

765
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,150
Where would such a thing be?

766
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,040
That is...

767
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,060
something I cannot reveal.

768
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:57,420
May I return to my room? It's cold outside.

769
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:01,080
That's because it's dusk here all year.

770
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,230
Oh, that's right.

771
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,200
Will you knit me a scarf?

772
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,660
A scarf just for me.

773
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,220
Do you refuse?

774
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,200
I understand.

775
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:21,880
Really? Thank you.

776
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,800
You've made me happy, Hinata.

777
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,200
What's wrong?

778
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,790
Don't worry.

779
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:37,350
It's proof that the Byakugan
is maturing into the Tenseigan.

780
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:40,170
It will subside with a little rest.

781
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:48,860
It doesn't seem to be here.

782
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,310
Byakugan Princess.

783
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:23,880
Activate the Tenseigan!

784
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:04,940
We are descendants of Hamura.

785
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,920
We belong to the main
family of the Otsutsuki clan.

786
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:11,010
We were annihilated by the branch family,

787
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:14,710
who have twisted the interpretation
of Hamura's celestial decree.

788
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:19,350
Toneri, a descendant of the branch family
is attempting to make the moon

789
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:23,050
fall into the Earth by using
the power of the Tenseigan.

790
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:31,440
Only you can destroy the
Tenseigan, Byakugan Princess.

791
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:47,600
You are...

792
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,840
Otsutsuki Hamura.

793
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,600
Byakugan Princess.

794
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:02,410
Do not let the world my elder
brother created come to an end.

795
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:13,080
Hanabi, you poor thing.

796
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:19,330
I'll definitely find and destroy the Tenseigan.

797
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,660
I can't believe that,

798
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,910
Toneri has been hiding in the artificial sun.

799
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:29,330
Why wasn't Hinata's Byakugan able to discover it?

800
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:33,550
Maybe he has a jutsu on the artificial
moon that deflects the Byakugan too?

801
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,540
Where's the entrance?

802
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:38,300
Why don't we ask them?

803
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,470
What are you doing?

804
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,000
You've alerted the enemy!

805
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:47,230
Follow me.

806
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,220
What are you doing?

807
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:50,410
I'll explain later!

808
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:05,000
So that's how it is.

809
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:07,330
Sai, retreat.

810
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:21,310
Super Beast Scroll!

811
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:33,510
I never imagined this guy's
debut would come after the war

812
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,340
with the world being at peace.

813
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:39,080
Below is the Chakra Diffusion Cannon.

814
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,450
We'll blast all the meteorites above the equator.

815
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:46,610
On top is the Chakra Transportation Cannon.

816
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:49,770
It can transport any target into another dimension.

817
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:52,730
With these, we'll destroy the moon.

818
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:55,880
Everyone, get the cannons ready immediately!

819
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,820
Meals are nice when you
have someone to talk to.

820
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:10,040
Now tell me all about yourself.

821
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,390
It's not too late to negotiate
with the Shinobi on Earth.

822
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:16,830
What?

823
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:17,830
You're right...

824
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:20,050
The Shinobi on Earth have used chakra

825
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:21,910
and continued fighting.

826
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:24,110
But it's different now.

827
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,750
In order to protect this hard-won peace

828
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:28,600
Shinobi have joined together.

829
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,580
So...

830
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:31,870
They will start another war.

831
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:35,080
The Sage of the Six Paths'
world must be destroyed.

832
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:36,410
But...

833
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,170
Never bring that subject up again!

834
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:42,670
Now be quiet and eat.

835
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,920
That island...

836
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:54,970
So it's appeared already.

837
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,860
That is the Temple of Hamura.

838
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:02,930
Once a year, during the Rebirth Festival,
it passes close to the castle.

839
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:10,200
There's no doubt about it.

840
01:05:11,290 --> 01:05:14,610
The Tenseigan is hidden on that island.

841
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:20,650
Naruto-kun...

842
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:22,440
goodbye.

843
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,220
Hinata...

844
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:28,210
Hinata!

845
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:30,190
So you're finally awake?

846
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:32,120
Finally?

847
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:34,230
It's been three days.

848
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:38,350
Did something happen between you and Hinata?

849
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,860
No, not really.

850
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:44,230
You kept groaning her name. Hinata, Hinata.

851
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,440
As well as some other embarrassing things.

852
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,220
But I got to listen in on your mushy side.

853
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,390
It was great research material for me.

854
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,210
Hey...

855
01:05:57,710 --> 01:05:59,000
Naruto.

856
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:01,090
Let's go rescue Hinata and Hanabi.

857
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,530
Is it hard to face the woman who rejected you?

858
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:10,690
So Naruto is strong as a Shinobi
but can't handle a broken heart?

859
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:12,400
Now I know your weakness.

860
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:13,500
Hey!

861
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:22,680
Hamura must be happy that you
personally want to pay homage.

862
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:32,670
The Tenseigan is inside here.

863
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:49,180
This is...

864
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:50,590
The Tenseigan.

865
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:54,290
Then this is Otsutsuki's treasure
that is moving the moon?

866
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:59,020
Hinata-sama, only those of exalted status

867
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:01,940
are allowed to see the real Tenseigan.

868
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:06,430
This is a temple where those
of lower rank come to pray.

869
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,330
I see.

870
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:17,230
I shall show you the real
Tenseigan after we are married.

871
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:33,360
My field of vision distorts at only that spot.

872
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,530
So that's it. I've got it!

873
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,220
How long are you going to be like this?

874
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,050
Well you gave up on a woman,

875
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:53,480
so why not give up on becoming Hokage too?

876
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:56,190
Yeah, just it give up.

877
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:58,760
Give up on the woman and
give up on becoming Hokage.

878
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:00,460
What was that, Shikamaru?

879
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,180
Are you trying to pick a fight?

880
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:04,910
I don't care what happens
between you and Hinata.

881
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,420
But you're a Shinobi!

882
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:09,850
Come with me.

883
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:25,370
I'm going to my room to rest.

884
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:28,960
I'm looking forward to the finished scarf.

885
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:48,010
I feel it, I can feel it.

886
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,710
The beating in my eyes!

887
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,120
It will be born very soon.

888
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:57,060
The complete Tenseigan.

889
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:06,840
Sakura-chan...

890
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:10,800
This is the result of infusing nearly
every ounce of her chakra into you

891
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,040
trying to keep you alive.

892
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:14,740
Sakura-chan!

893
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:19,530
Naruto.

894
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,620
Sakura-chan, I'm so sorry.

895
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:26,910
Are you going to depend on Sakura to heal
not only his body, but his heart as well?

896
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:29,110
Can you do it?

897
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:31,950
You have a point.

898
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:36,560
I see.

899
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:40,950
I never imagined you'd confess your love first.

900
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:46,800
Remember long ago, when
you said you loved me?

901
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:52,900
But wasn't that because I loved Sasuke-kun?

902
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,440
You didn't want to lose to him.

903
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,860
But it's the real thing this time, isn't it?

904
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,330
Hinata is a great person.

905
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,950
She's almost too good for you.

906
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:09,400
But it's over.

907
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:12,600
Hinata went to Toneri.

908
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,240
You're so stupid.

909
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,540
It's obvious she had a reason
that she couldn't reveal.

910
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:22,010
When a girl truly falls in love,

911
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:24,750
her feelings don't change that easily.

912
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,020
They can't change.

913
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:31,280
I understand how she feels very well.

914
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:04,600
This is...

915
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:09,510
Tenseigan.

916
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:19,460
I'll stop the moon!

917
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:46,060
What's the meaning of this?

918
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:47,820
You're wrong!

919
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:49,620
What?

920
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,510
Hamura's soul entrusted me
with the true celestial decree.

921
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:57,220
You have distorted Hamura's teachings.

922
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:00,150
Hamura never wished for
the destruction of Earth...

923
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,860
the Sage of Six Path's world!

924
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:07,910
You've betrayed me.

925
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:11,350
Please hear me out! Hamura is...

926
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:12,640
Silence! They're lies.

927
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,660
I don't believe it.

928
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:17,610
There is only one celestial
decree that Hamura made,

929
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:20,260
and that is to end the world,
of the Sage of Six Paths!

930
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:21,350
Damn it!

931
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,330
So you were knitting this

932
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:25,270
for him and not for me?

933
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:38,840
I'm going to make it so
you'll never betray me

934
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,500
ever again!

935
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,550
Hinata...

936
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:49,730
This big idiot finally understands,

937
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:56,440
the meaning of the scarf you
gave me when you went to Toneri.

938
01:12:58,130 --> 01:13:01,880
Now, I know from the scarf
you painstakingly knitted,

939
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,820
and took so long to finish,

940
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:07,750
that your love can't be unraveled so easily.

941
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:17,510
Naruto-kun...

942
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:21,620
Wait for me.

943
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:26,820
You've loved someone like me all this time.

944
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:30,600
Now, as a man, there's something
I've got to say to you.

945
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:40,530
Hinata, I swear I'll save you!

946
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:26,840
Raikage-sama, the Chakra Cannons are ready.

947
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:30,400
All right. Men, load the chakra.

948
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:31,420
Yes sir.

949
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:34,620
First, we'll fire the Chakra Diffusion
Cannon to pulverize the meteorites.

950
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:36,860
Pulverize. Powderize!

951
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:04,450
Cover me!

952
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:05,250
Right!

953
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:06,860
Rasen Shuriken!

954
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:13,730
Shadow Paralysis jutsu!

955
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,260
Next...

956
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:23,840
We're storming the castle!

957
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:24,950
Right!

958
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:33,730
Sakura-chan!

959
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,810
Thanks, Naruto.

960
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:45,590
No need to thank me.

961
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:48,810
I owe a debt to you that
I'll never be able to repay.

962
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,360
What a pain.

963
01:15:58,810 --> 01:15:59,940
Why are you hiding it?

964
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:03,580
It's irritating, and it's
clouding my judgement.

965
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,620
Naruto, can you sense Hanabi's chakra?

966
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,800
Hanabi is in that tower over there.

967
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:18,020
Sakura, Sai... Take care of Hanabi.

968
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:18,890
Roger!

969
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:49,440
Hinata!

970
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:50,950
You bastard!

971
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:00,600
Your fists won't ever touch me.

972
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,660
Naruto, where's Hinata?

973
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:05,930
In there!

974
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:09,970
I'll handle things here.

975
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:10,950
Thanks.

976
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,950
Move!

977
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:21,080
I won't let you pass.

978
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:24,020
All right, the puppet show begins now.

979
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:28,220
Hanabi is above here.

980
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:33,860
What?

981
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:41,810
This way!

982
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,360
Hinata...

983
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,260
Wind Style: Sky Sand Defensive Wall.

984
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:07,620
At six o'clock! It's a huge one!

985
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:09,730
Everyone! Crane wing formation!

986
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:11,160
Roger!

987
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,750
The Sixth Gate Of Joy!

988
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,890
Damn it!

989
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:47,770
You're...!

990
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,310
If he's not around,

991
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,800
The only one who can protect the village

992
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:55,750
is me.

993
01:18:58,660 --> 01:18:59,930
Sasuke.

994
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,280
The meteorites are gone.

995
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:03,730
Hokage-sama.

996
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:04,780
What is it?

997
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:07,710
Hiashi-san?

998
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:11,260
Chakra capacity at 75%

999
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:14,990
76, 77...

1000
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:20,320
One after the other.

1001
01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:31,860
Now, go in.

1002
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,330
Hinata!

1003
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,680
What did you do?

1004
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,020
Give Hinata back!

1005
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:42,330
Fine, I'll give her back.

1006
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:50,930
Stop, Hinata!

1007
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:55,370
What do you think of my wife's skills?

1008
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:57,060
Damn it!

1009
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,640
He's controlling her.

1010
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,130
Hinata...

1011
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:07,370
Bear with it for just a moment.

1012
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:20,880
Hinata isn't a doll for you to manipulate!

1013
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:25,350
Hinata belongs to me. I'm taking her back.

1014
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:30,840
Hinata...

1015
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,620
Get back.

1016
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:45,910
It's too early for you to wake up.

1017
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,510
Damn, the final pulsation!

1018
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,240
Naruto-kun!

1019
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,460
Hinata!

1020
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,700
Naruto-kun, I'm so sorry...

1021
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:07,460
I...

1022
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:10,060
I understand, you don't need to say anything.

1023
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:12,200
I'm the one who has to apologize.

1024
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,080
But what about him?

1025
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,370
Now's our chance,

1026
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,460
we have to destroy the Tenseigan!

1027
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,060
Tenseigan?

1028
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:25,460
Hanabi!

1029
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,910
How terrible.

1030
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:29,330
She's just a child.

1031
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:37,620
Hinata...

1032
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:44,310
If we destroy this the moon
should stop its approach.

1033
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:46,770
Got it. I'll use my Rasengan.

1034
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:47,420
No!

1035
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:50,630
There is a cursed jutsu cast upon this eye.

1036
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,530
Only someone of Hamura's
bloodline can touch it.

1037
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:55,200
Anyone else will be completely
drained of their chakra.

1038
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,050
What?

1039
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:07,480
Eight Trigrams: Twin Lion Shot

1040
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,860
I can't destroy it!

1041
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:33,280
Hinata, infuse me with your chakra.

1042
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:37,830
Then together we might be able to break it apart.

1043
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:40,860
Okay.

1044
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,300
Let's go.

1045
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:47,440
Okay.

1046
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:17,720
These are...

1047
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:22,140
The Tenseigan was made out
of clusters of Byakugan?

1048
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,010
What?

1049
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:04,750
Hokage-sama,

1050
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:06,550
the moon has stopped its approach.

1051
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:07,740
What?

1052
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:13,160
Chakra capacity at 95%

1053
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:18,270
96, 97, 98, 99...

1054
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:21,470
Chakra is at 100%

1055
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:23,820
Chakra Diffusion Cannon fire!

1056
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:25,070
Yeah!

1057
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:50,560
What just happened?

1058
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,430
An urgent message from the Cloud Village,

1059
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:55,420
a Five Kage summit is being convened.

1060
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,380
All the meteorites have been destroyed.

1061
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,800
So you had such a weapon
like that hidden away?

1062
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:03,570
It seems we can not be too
careful with you, Raikage-dono.

1063
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:06,020
Tsuchikage-sama, let's drop the sarcasm!

1064
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:08,530
Next up is the Chakra Transportation Cannon.

1065
01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:10,300
We'll blow up the moon!

1066
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,800
Blow up the moon?

1067
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:18,610
What's happening?

1068
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,470
Shikamaru!

1069
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:23,840
Hinata, are you all right?

1070
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,710
Yes, I'm sorry.

1071
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:28,970
Save that for later.

1072
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:33,610
Anyway, what happened?
The artificial sun disappeared.

1073
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,700
We destroyed the Tenseigan.
It was the power source

1074
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,430
driving everything here.

1075
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:40,420
The moon should've stopped moving too.

1076
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,480
What?

1077
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:53,680
The treasure that my entire clan
offered up their eyes to realize...

1078
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,270
the Otsutsuki treasure...

1079
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:57,040
How dare they!

1080
01:25:58,210 --> 01:25:59,430
Hanabi!

1081
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:01,580
Thank you.

1082
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:04,060
This is yours, right?

1083
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:13,470
Isn't that the scarf Toneri ripped off?

1084
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:16,190
How did you know?

1085
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:19,130
When I pulled Toneri's jutsu from your body,

1086
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:21,500
I was able to see your memories.

1087
01:26:22,170 --> 01:26:24,790
You were going to give it to Naruto, right?

1088
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,950
Did you make it for me?

1089
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:34,590
Y-yeah...

1090
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:38,080
Can I have it?

1091
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:41,660
But, it's in shreds.

1092
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:43,890
I don't care.

1093
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:48,550
I mean, I still want it.

1094
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:05,560
Thank you.

1095
01:27:09,210 --> 01:27:10,830
I'll cherish it.

1096
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:16,770
Naruto-kun...

1097
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:23,210
What's the matter?

1098
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:24,990
The clock...

1099
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,450
It's moving.

1100
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:34,610
With these eyes, Naruto,

1101
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:39,410
I will destroy your world.

1102
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,270
It's too dangerous to destroy the moon.

1103
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:48,360
As long as that bomb we call a moon exists,

1104
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:51,300
the Earth will not be safe!

1105
01:27:51,690 --> 01:27:53,950
Now let's discuss this calmly.

1106
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:56,490
Right now, the moon has stopped its approach.

1107
01:27:56,490 --> 01:27:58,940
No, it hasn't stopped.

1108
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,110
What?

1109
01:28:05,130 --> 01:28:07,310
Why is the clock ticking again?

1110
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:08,400
I don't know.

1111
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:15,310
W-what was that?

1112
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:37,580
Kurama!

1113
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:17,720
Kurama!

1114
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:20,140
It's Toneri!

1115
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:37,000
Silver Wheel Rebirth Explosion!

1116
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:01,330
Chakra capacity at 90%

1117
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:02,660
Hokage-sama!

1118
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:05,110
Hiashi-san would like to speak with you.

1119
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:06,450
Hiashi-san?

1120
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:11,820
Do not destroy the moon...

1121
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:15,770
I'm certain that Hanabi and Hinata are there.

1122
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:17,930
What do you mean by that?

1123
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,420
Bad news...

1124
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:20,200
What is it?

1125
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,060
The Nine Tails is on the moon's surface.

1126
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:22,630
What?

1127
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:55,350
Chakra capacity at 95%

1128
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:58,760
Raikage-sama, an urgent
message from Hokage-sama.

1129
01:30:58,940 --> 01:31:00,980
What does he want at a time like this?

1130
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:03,550
Please hold off on the chakra cannons.

1131
01:31:03,550 --> 01:31:05,360
Naruto and the others are on the moon.

1132
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:06,700
That can't be helped.

1133
01:31:06,770 --> 01:31:09,860
They have to be sacrificed for
the sake of humanity and the Earth.

1134
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:12,620
We're going to fire the
Chakra Transportation Cannon!

1135
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:13,950
Raikage-dono...

1136
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:14,660
What is it?

1137
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:18,060
I'm asking you too.
Can you postpone for one hour?

1138
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:18,810
What?

1139
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:20,180
I have to agree.

1140
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:21,250
Mizukage?!

1141
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:23,350
Naruto is a hero of the last great war.

1142
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,450
He's worth betting on.

1143
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:26,730
Tsuchikage?!

1144
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:32,860
Just one hour will do.

1145
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:37,000
For them, that amount of time
will be worth a lifetime

1146
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,940
that can never be replaced!

1147
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:43,150
What do you base that on?

1148
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,310
My intuition.

1149
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,710
Hinata, are you okay?

1150
01:31:49,790 --> 01:31:50,590
Y-yes.

1151
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:54,630
No!

1152
01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:05,660
I'm taking Hinata back.

1153
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:09,950
You can watch his last moments from there.

1154
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:15,180
Hinata!

1155
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,840
Naruto-kun!

1156
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:54,380
The world created by the
Sage of the Six Paths is a failure.

1157
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:57,550
I will put an end to both the Earth and to you!

1158
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:05,100
I'll never let the Earth be destroyed!

1159
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:16,590
Rasen Rengan!

1160
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:37,480
Golden Wheel Rebirth Explosion!

1161
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:40,660
Naruto-kun!

1162
01:33:57,950 --> 01:33:59,280
What is that?

1163
01:34:03,590 --> 01:34:04,670
The moon...

1164
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:06,130
The moon has split apart!

1165
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:07,190
What?

1166
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:10,800
What's happening?

1167
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:12,540
Hey, Hokage...

1168
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,230
There's ten minutes left!

1169
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,930
It's finally over.

1170
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:24,230
It's not over yet!

1171
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:27,820
What?!

1172
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:39,970
Chou Oodama Rasen

1173
01:34:39,970 --> 01:34:41,170
Tarrengan!

1174
01:35:05,850 --> 01:35:08,310
It's useless. Just give up.

1175
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:10,220
Like I'd ever give up.

1176
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:13,230
It takes time to knit a scarf.

1177
01:35:13,230 --> 01:35:15,750
The deeper the feelings that you want to convey,

1178
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,910
the longer it takes to knit.

1179
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,750
With this, it's over!

1180
01:35:29,470 --> 01:35:31,880
Like I'd ever let you!

1181
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:34,450
To convey your feelings,

1182
01:35:34,450 --> 01:35:38,240
it takes much, much, more time!

1183
01:35:38,730 --> 01:35:40,170
That's why...

1184
01:35:40,170 --> 01:35:44,800
I can't let it end so easily!

1185
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:00,200
You...

1186
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:04,340
...defeated me, with one punch.

1187
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:09,150
The Tenseigan is fading?!

1188
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:21,880
Hinata!

1189
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:23,280
Naruto-kun!

1190
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:32,730
I'm taking back Hanabi's eyes.

1191
01:36:33,310 --> 01:36:36,770
No, stop!

1192
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:39,350
Why you!?

1193
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:42,730
This is over.

1194
01:36:43,930 --> 01:36:44,970
Not yet!

1195
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:50,930
Sakura, are you okay?

1196
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:52,880
What about Naruto and the others?

1197
01:36:52,910 --> 01:36:54,620
I don't know.

1198
01:36:58,590 --> 01:37:00,930
W-what is going on?

1199
01:37:06,210 --> 01:37:09,620
I'll end it all with these eyes.

1200
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,680
Puppet rebirth!

1201
01:37:17,850 --> 01:37:19,620
You're annoying!

1202
01:37:25,270 --> 01:37:26,240
Naruto.

1203
01:37:26,450 --> 01:37:27,450
Hinata!

1204
01:37:29,740 --> 01:37:31,480
Toneri, please stop already!

1205
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:34,720
All you did was follow your
ancestor's misguided teachings.

1206
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:38,860
Quiet! As the last survivor of the Otsutsuki clan

1207
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:42,510
I must fulfill Hamura's celestial decree!

1208
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:45,840
Naruto-kun?

1209
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,930
All my chakra's being sucked out.

1210
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:55,850
Now you'll feel the power of Hamura,

1211
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,770
the power to move the moon!

1212
01:37:57,850 --> 01:38:00,560
Naruto, it's over for you!

1213
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:07,050
Hinata?

1214
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:15,130
What?

1215
01:38:15,290 --> 01:38:17,630
This is not the end yet.

1216
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:18,750
Why?

1217
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:22,370
Hamura's chakra flows within me too.

1218
01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:23,800
Stop already.

1219
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:29,860
End it, end the world of
The Sage of the Six Paths!

1220
01:38:34,510 --> 01:38:38,420
I will destroy the Sage's world
that has fallen into darkness

1221
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:40,640
with the light of justice!

1222
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:06,460
What?

1223
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:09,660
His jutsu absorbed the sun's energy

1224
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:12,060
and now he's passed his chakra limit.

1225
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:22,750
Naruto-kun?!

1226
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,930
Don't! It's too dangerous!

1227
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:31,170
Time's up.

1228
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:34,080
Fire the Chakra Transformation Cannon.

1229
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:38,510
What's wrong?

1230
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:40,970
I can't shoot at Naruto.

1231
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:42,750
You must stifle your personal feelings.

1232
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:45,420
The very existence of Earth depends on this.

1233
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:48,400
Move! I'll fire it!

1234
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,880
Raikage-sama, there is
something written on the moon...

1235
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,000
What?

1236
01:39:52,510 --> 01:39:55,240
Kurama is writing something on the moon's surface.

1237
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:56,130
What?

1238
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:01,530
That Shinobi character means...

1239
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:03,700
'Mission accomplished'.

1240
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:05,350
The mission was successful!

1241
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,110
I see.

1242
01:40:12,370 --> 01:40:14,840
Emergency announcement to the entire world...

1243
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:16,470
The moon has stopped,

1244
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:20,340
thanks to the effort of these five:

1245
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:24,400
Shikamaru, Sakura, Sai, Hinata, and Naruto.

1246
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:27,550
Earth and it's future are safe.

1247
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:32,600
My intuition usually ends on a high note.

1248
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,060
Making me write letters...

1249
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:40,600
I'm no good at calligraphy!

1250
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,670
Sorry, Kurama.

1251
01:40:50,610 --> 01:40:51,440
This is...

1252
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:56,040
Hamura's soul guided me here.

1253
01:41:02,030 --> 01:41:06,800
Toneri, everyone on Earth will welcome you.

1254
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:10,150
I will remain on the moon and atone for my sins.

1255
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:13,600
Toneri...

1256
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:17,220
One day... One day, come to Earth.

1257
01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:23,400
The moon will never again approach Earth.

1258
01:41:24,770 --> 01:41:26,110
Never again.

1259
01:41:32,530 --> 01:41:36,200
Naruto, there is something I have to ask you.

1260
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:37,600
What is it?

1261
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:40,420
That scarf...

1262
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:41,970
Who gave it to you?

1263
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:44,440
Oh, this.

1264
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:48,620
My late Mom made it for me.

1265
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:49,680
What?

1266
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:53,060
My grandpa must've kept it for her.

1267
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:54,520
Mom...

1268
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:57,020
I see.

1269
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:58,510
I'm so silly.

1270
01:41:58,510 --> 01:42:00,480
Hey, Sis!

1271
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:04,280
How long are you going to chitchat?
I'm going on ahead of you!

1272
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:07,570
Hurry up, the passageway
is starting to disintegrate.

1273
01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:12,080
Let's go home to Earth.

1274
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:13,470
Yes.

1275
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:32,350
Hinata...

1276
01:42:32,350 --> 01:42:33,080
What is it?

1277
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:35,640
Back in school when we were asked

1278
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:38,330
who we'd want to spend
our last day on Earth with...

1279
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:41,100
I couldn't write anyone's name down.

1280
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:44,700
I didn't know my parents
and didn't have any friends.

1281
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:48,640
But now, I know exactly who I'd choose.

1282
01:42:49,370 --> 01:42:52,680
I want to stay with you!

1283
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:57,260
Now and forever, until the day I die.

1284
01:42:58,070 --> 01:43:00,200
I want to be with you, Hinata.

1285
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:03,540
Naruto-kun...

1286
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:46,960
Naruto-kun...

1287
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:49,330
Hinata, put your arms around me.

1288
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:53,060
O-okay.

1289
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,350
Don't let go, okay?

1290
01:44:57,540 --> 01:44:58,650
I won't.

1291
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:05,040
I'll never let go.

1292
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:10,330
What are you doing?

1293
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:18,910
Sis!

1294
01:45:18,910 --> 01:45:21,600
Naruto! You're going to crash into the ceiling!

1295
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,860
Like I'm going to let that stop me!

1296
01:45:39,530 --> 01:45:40,520
Hinata...

1297
01:45:41,410 --> 01:45:42,550
Naruto-kun...

1298
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:02,500
Hinata...

1299
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:04,200
Thank you.

1300
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:50,100
Doushite? Doushite naite umarete

1301
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:50,100
Why? I wonder why we cry when we’re born.

1302
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:55,900
Itsuka nagarete hoshi ni natte ikun darou?

1303
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:55,900
Some day our tears will flow until it reaches the stars.

1304
01:46:55,900 --> 01:47:01,500
Boku ra wa doushite? Doushite osowatte nai no ni

1305
01:46:55,900 --> 01:47:01,500
Why? I wonder why we know how to shed tears,

1306
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:07,700
namida no nagashi katta wa shitterun darou?

1307
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:07,700
despite not being taught how.

1308
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:13,500
Afureru shizuku wa taema naku

1309
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:13,500
This overflow of teardrops shed incessantly,

1310
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:19,200
sosogareta aijou no akashi de

1311
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:19,200
is the proof of our affection.

1312
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:31,200
Michibikareru mama yuruyaka ni sotto tsutatte kitan da

1313
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:31,200
Gently and softly guides to go and come back.

1314
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:40,600
Kokorokara karada e karada wa kokoro e

1315
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:40,600
From heart to body and from body to heart.

1316
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:46,700
Soranaru ikutsumono karamiatta rasen no moyou

1317
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:46,700
Continuous pattern of many intertwined spirals.

1318
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:52,700
Sono hitotsu hitotsu ni mirai ga mietanara

1319
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:52,700
One by one our future can be seen,

1320
01:47:52,700 --> 01:48:00,700
nagameteiru kono sora wa hora uchuu ni mieru

1321
01:47:52,700 --> 01:48:00,700
in the sky we’re looking at, look, look to the universe.

1322
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:15,600
Doushite? Doushite tsuki wa itsudemo

1323
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:15,600
Why? I wonder why the moon always,

1324
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:21,900
Nani mo iwanaide yami wo terashiterun darou?

1325
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:21,900
without saying anything, is shining light upon the darkness.

1326
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:27,700
Boku ra wa doushite? Doushite kodou no kazu ni

1327
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:27,700
Why? I wonder if we know that there’s a limit,

1328
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:33,700
kagiri ga aru no wo shittete mudanishichaun darou?

1329
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:33,700
it makes these heart beats completely futile.

1330
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:39,500
Mune ni kakaeteru utsuwa no

1331
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:39,500
The size of the vessel carried in one’s chest,

1332
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:45,200
okisa ni kachi mo miidasun janakute

1333
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:45,200
is not to determine our value.

1334
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:57,500
Sono naka ni aru betsu no okina tane ni inochi wo kanjitai

1335
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:57,500
It's if something else inside exists to experience life.

1336
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:06,700
Donna ni me wo konashite jibun wo miyou toshitemo

1337
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:06,700
No matter how hard you look, if you try to see by yourself.

1338
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:12,500
Boyakette yoku mienai ya sono uchi miushinatte shimau

1339
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:12,500
It's blurry and you will end up completely losing sight of them.

1340
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:18,700
Sagaseba sagasu hodo chirakashite shimau nara

1341
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:18,700
At the end of your searching, if it's completely scattered,

1342
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:27,400
miyoumimare datte kono te de sou tsukureba ii

1343
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:27,400
learn by watching others by doing this, you’ll be fine.

1344
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:47,500
Ikiru tte iu koto sore wa kitto

1345
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:47,500
When talking about living is surely,

1346
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:53,200
sukoshizutsu tebanashite iku koto

1347
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:53,200
little by little parted with many things.

1348
01:49:53,200 --> 01:50:03,600
Saigo no hitotsu wo ushinau sumu toki soba ni itte

1349
01:49:53,200 --> 01:50:03,600
After parting with the last one, please by my side,

1350
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:14,500
namida wo kureru hito ga iru sore de ureshii

1351
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:14,500
I will give you tears and they will be happy tears.

1352
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:20,900
Kokorokara karada e karada wa kokoro e

1353
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:20,900
From heart to body and from body to heart.

1354
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:26,700
Soranaru ikutsumono uketsuge rasen no moyou

1355
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:26,700
Continuous pattern of many succeeding spirals.

1356
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:32,700
Kurikaesarete koto ga mou iya da to omoeta toki

1357
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:32,700
Doing this repeatedly until the time comes i say no way.

1358
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:41,800
menomae no keshiki subete ga ima uchuu ni natta

1359
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:41,800
now the entire scenery before my eyes is become universe,

1360
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,200
uchuu ni natta

1361
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,200
it become universe.

1362
01:51:30,540 --> 01:51:31,670
Daddy!

1363
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:32,650
Daddy!

1364
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:35,810
Play with us!

1365
01:51:36,510 --> 01:51:39,600
Hey, don't go outside with bare feet!

1366
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,840
All right, Boruto, Himawari...

1367
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,250
How about a snow ball fight?

1368
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:44,910
Snowball fight?!

1369
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:46,800
Take that!

1370
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:48,150
Hey, Boruto!

1371
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:50,290
All right, Mom is joining in too!

1372
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:55,930
Hey, you guys know when Mom
gets serious, she's super strong!
