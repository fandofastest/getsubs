1
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,039
Let's play some hockey!

2
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,356
This is Joy, coming to you live
in Riley's mind,

3
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,114
and we are expecting
a great championship today

4
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,992
with the Foghorns.

5
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,117
Riley fans, get up on your feet,

6
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,352
and make some noise!

7
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,510
Go, go, go!

8
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,433
Let's go, Foghorns!

9
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,270
Bring it in!

10
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,555
Foghorns on three.

11
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,392
- One, two, three...
- Foghorns!

12
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,594
Now, it's time to greet your Team Riley!

13
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,079
Playing in his 13th year,

14
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,912
and fresh from the penalty box,

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,911
it's Riley's Anger!

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,832
Let me at 'em!

17
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,994
Helmet, pads, gloves,

18
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,350
safety checklist is complete.

19
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,351
It should be nothing
but smooth sailing from...

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,078
Look out!

21
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,595
And that's Fear,
keeping Riley on her toes.

22
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,910
We gotta get our mouth guard, people.

23
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,471
No, no, no! That's not ours!

24
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,119
And that, folks,

25
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,032
is the infamous Disqust.

26
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,394
Glad to have her on our team.

27
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,037
Twenty-eight. Andersen, tripping.

28
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,394
Oh, no...

29
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,079
And bringing up the rear,

30
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,833
you know her, you love her,

31
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,752
the one, the only...

32
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,309
We got a penalty.

33
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,790
That's right,

34
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,996
Sadness is in the house!

35
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,195
Yay...

36
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,237
Andersen goes to the box.

37
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,594
Two minutes for tripping.

38
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,432
Okay, looks like
we have a couple of minutes

39
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,352
while Riley takes a breather.

40
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,430
Let me catch you up.

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,435
Riley is still exceptional.

42
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,555
Ta-da!

43
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,279
And not just because she's the top
of her class...

44
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,997
- Riley Andersen.
- Which, by the way, she is.

45
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,354
Riley, Riley, over here!

46
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,954
She's also really kind,

47
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,156
and she's nice to stray cats,

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,310
I mean, come on.

49
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,038
Oh, and she's officially

50
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,349
a teenager now.

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,438
She got very tall, very fast.

52
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,397
Did we grow overnight?

53
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,199
That was our favorite shirt.

54
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,790
We even got braces
with extra rubber bands!

55
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,553
- How does it feel?
- Great!

56
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,914
Sorry.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,755
Riley's Personality Islands
are still going strong.

58
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,434
Glad to see Boy Band Island
finally broke up.

59
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,353
But Goofball is still
monkeying around.

60
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,033
Wait, where's Family Island?

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,519
It's right there.

62
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,631
Oh, there it is.

63
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,677
What's that blocking it?

64
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,154
Oh, that's Friendship Island.

65
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,594
Isn't it amazing?

66
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,112
But we realized her islands
aren't the only things made by memories.

67
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,032
Way down, at the root level,

68
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,431
these memories
were also creating beliefs.

69
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,431
Homework should be illegal.

70
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,952
Get Up and Glow
is the best band ever!

71
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,075
And my personal favorite...

72
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,633
I'm a really good friend.

73
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,439
Did you know the change in your couch

74
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,477
could change the world?
Oh, no!

75
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,439
Oh, no, we should do something.

76
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,477
No! That girl is a social Titanic.

77
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,198
Do not get on that ship.

78
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,509
Guys...

79
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,950
That is so pretty.

80
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,998
It's okay. I drop things all the time.

81
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,154
I'm Riley.

82
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,069
I'm Grace.

83
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,075
I'm Bree.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,150
Turns out when you put
all of those beliefs together,

85
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,749
they make the most wonderful
thing of all.

86
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,717
Her Sense of Self.

87
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,473
I'm a good person.

88
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,234
It's what helps Riley
make good choices.

89
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,838
Thirteen years of hard work,

90
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,033
all wrapped up in what some
might call our masterpiece.

91
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,155
You know, one of the hardest

92
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,230
challenges we found...

93
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,549
Oh, my gosh!
We're back in the game.

94
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,717
We're tied.

95
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,518
How are we gonna score in time?

96
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,273
We use our slap shot!

97
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,078
No, no, no. We charge the goalie!

98
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,629
But Grace hasn't scored yet.

99
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,479
Riley's got this.

100
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,318
Thread the needle!

101
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,995
Come on, Riley.

102
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,551
Awooga!

103
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,114
Awooga!

104
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,192
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!
Look at that! That's my girl!

105
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,238
And the Foghorns
win the championship!

106
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,797
- She shoots and she scores!
- Champions, baby!

107
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,836
Hey, girls.

108
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,718
Congratulations on your win.

109
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,235
That's the high school coach!

110
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,834
What a game!

111
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,593
That last play?

112
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,671
The three of you were impressive.

113
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,080
Thanks, Coach Roberts.

114
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,434
Look, it's last minute,

115
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,433
but every year,
I do a three-day skills camp.

116
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,352
I invite all the best players
in the area.

117
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,477
I'd love for you girls to come.

118
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,634
Are we in a dream right now?

119
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,273
Please, can somebody pinch me?

120
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,555
Definitely awake.

121
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,000
If we impress Coach,

122
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,832
she'll put the three of us
on the team next year.

123
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,638
The Fire Hawks!

124
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,473
Finally, a team I can get behind.

125
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,709
What do you say?

126
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,790
- Yes!
- Absolutely yes.

127
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,598
- We're there!
- Thank you, thank you, thank you!

128
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,398
Great. We'll see you tomorrow.

129
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,359
This is amazing!

130
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,633
What a big day!

131
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,199
You are such an all-star!

132
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,556
You are gonna knock
the coach's skates off!

133
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,790
Hockey scholarship, here we come!

134
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,870
Dad, stop.

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,638
It's just hockey camp.

136
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,836
I mean, who knows what'll happen?

137
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,473
Twenty-eight. Andersen,

138
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,755
tripping.

139
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,639
My penalty almost lost us
the game today.

140
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,711
What if I get to camp and I screw it up?

141
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,199
Hey, don't talk like that.

142
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,396
Yeah, you did great today, honey.

143
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,352
Exactly. Mom gets it.

144
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,314
Yeah, I guess.

145
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,272
We're so proud of you.

146
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,073
Night, monkey.

147
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,639
All right, all right.

148
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,915
Sleep tight, honey.

149
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,433
Oh, Riley's so hard on herself.

150
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,477
But we can make everything easier.

151
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,074
Behold, my super high-tech
Riley protection system.

152
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,432
Don't look, it's fine.

153
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,354
This is for all those memories
that belong in the Back of the Mind,

154
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,113
like this penalty one.

155
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,953
It's weighing on her,
so let's lighten the load.

156
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,792
A one-way expressway to...

157
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,599
We're not gonna think
about that right now.

158
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,556
- Not bad.
- Oh, Joy.

159
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,960
- That's pretty impressive.
- You worked hard.

160
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,156
You take such good care of Riley.

161
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,839
Thanks, I try.

162
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,319
Okay, let's do a sweep.

163
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,678
Oh, here's one where she waved at a guy

164
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,956
who was actually waving
at a girl behind her.

165
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,196
Oh, that was so bad. Good choice.

166
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,874
Oh, here's when she forgot
that girl's name.

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,035
Oh, yeah, that was super awkward.

168
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,315
What was her name?

169
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,232
I don't know, Janet or something?
Whatever. Let's just get rid of it.

170
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,594
We keep the best
and toss the rest.

171
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,954
Nice work, everyone.

172
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,030
All right, Anger,

173
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,236
the rest of these babies
can go to long-term.

174
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,831
Oh, okay.
Let's get some shut-eye.

175
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,399
Big day tomorrow.

176
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,351
Joy, are you taking that

177
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,875
where I think you're taking that?

178
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,190
- Wanna come this time?
- Yes.

179
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,270
I mean no. I...

180
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,795
Oh, no. I really shouldn't.

181
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,838
You know, you're the only one
who hasn't been to the Belief System.

182
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,394
Yeah, it's just that it's new,

183
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,232
and I know how important it is.

184
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,556
And I don't wanna mess it up
or break it,

185
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,029
or burn it to the ground or anything.

186
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,634
Sadness, you won't hurt it, I promise.

187
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,233
Have I ever steered you wrong before?

188
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,197
Yeah, many times.

189
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,395
Come on.

190
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,910
Where I go, you go.

191
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,073
Oh, my goodness.

192
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,351
Mom and Dad are proud of me.

193
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,078
An oldie but a goodie.

194
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,913
I'm kind.

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,877
That's nice.

196
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,119
I'm strong. I'm brave.

197
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,679
I'm a really good friend.

198
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,354
I'm a winner.

199
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,750
And all those beliefs
come together

200
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,275
to make our Riley.

201
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,714
I'm a good person.

202
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,474
What the heck is that?

203
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,554
Turn that off, Joy!

204
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,995
People, it's the apocalypse!

205
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,150
No!

206
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,435
What are you doing?

207
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,234
Problem solved.

208
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,589
Joy.

209
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,517
Okay, let's clear it all out.

210
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,035
It's demo day.

211
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,670
Demo?

212
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,194
Wait, wait, what's happening?

213
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,793
What's going on?

214
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,071
Who are you people?

215
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,317
Hey, are you the one
in charge here?

216
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,719
Could you do me a favor and stop
tearing Headquarters apart?

217
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,074
No can do. Didn't you hear?

218
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,275
Permits just came through.

219
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,919
Permits? For what?

220
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,354
For expanding the place.

221
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,879
You know, for the others.

222
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,110
What others?

223
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,350
They're not here yet?

224
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,192
Hey, Margie, you got that console?

225
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,958
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Give me a sec!

226
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,030
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

227
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,236
- All right. She's all set.
- Set with what?

228
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,674
Come on, Riley. Get up.

229
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,478
Camp time.

230
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,153
Lunch break!

231
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,993
Wait, wait!
You can't leave it like this.

232
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,639
Don't worry, we'll be back.

233
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,915
Come on. We're gonna be late.

234
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,718
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Let's go!

235
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,630
Riley, you aren't packed yet?

236
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,076
You're always on me!

237
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,834
Can't you just lay off for,
like, one second?

238
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,593
Overreact much?

239
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,034
I barely touched it.

240
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,077
Those morons broke the console.

241
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,958
Riley, what's wrong?

242
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,270
Oh, Mom looks sad.

243
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,516
I'm the worst!

244
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,238
Oh, no. Honey.

245
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,759
I barely touched it.

246
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,910
That's what I said.

247
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,757
Let the professional handle this.

248
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,631
I'm too gross to go to camp
or anywhere ever again!

249
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,639
Oh, yeah, this is totally broken.

250
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,996
Well, we all knew this day would come.

251
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,594
Remember, we agreed not to
make a big deal about this.

252
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,119
But she really does stink.

253
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,190
Oh, it's bad.

254
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,238
Remain calm.
Stick to the prepared script.

255
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,675
You are not gross, honey.

256
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,876
You're just changing.

257
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,473
Remember that beautiful butterfly

258
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,153
we saw in the park last week?

259
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,639
Well, that butterfly
began as a caterpillar.

260
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,710
Easy...

261
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,870
And just like that caterpillar...

262
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,995
Easy...

263
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,195
You're about to get your wings.

264
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,152
- But if you have questions...
- Oh, my gosh, Mom!

265
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,476
Just go away!

266
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,999
Well, that's a preview
of the next 10 years.

267
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,358
- Riley!
- Oh, my gosh!

268
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,919
- We're gonna have so much fun!
- All right.

269
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,519
Who's ready for hockey camp?

270
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,749
Oh, yeah!

271
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,638
Okay, until we can
figure this out,

272
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,155
nobody touch the console
unless you really need to.

273
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,513
So, big weekend for us.
What do you wanna do?

274
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,318
Well, we could finally
clean out the garage.

275
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,152
Or, actually, we can get upstairs...

276
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,311
How great is next year gonna be?

277
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,030
Coach Roberts' team has been
state champs like every year.

278
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,397
And Val Ortiz is the captain now.

279
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,632
This Valentina Ortiz obsession
is outta control.

280
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,314
She made the Fire Hawks
when she was only a freshman.

281
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,118
That's really hard.

282
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,356
All we have to do
is be super awesome at camp,

283
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,274
Coach will put us on the team,
and we'll all be Fire Hawks!

284
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,673
- Wait, what was that?
- What was what?

285
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,717
We got a look. I don't like this.

286
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,074
What? You're paranoid.

287
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,309
I never miss a look.

288
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,278
Enhance 224... 176.

289
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,317
Track right. Zoom in.

290
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,516
Right there!

291
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,716
- So?
- She's hiding something.

292
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,029
But what?

293
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,799
What is she doing?

294
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,109
She's looking at our look!

295
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,919
No, it's much more than that.

296
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,638
She looks the same to me.

297
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,119
Overlay and compare.

298
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,830
See? Riley then, Riley now.
Riley then, Riley now.

299
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,593
It's so obvious!

300
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,670
But what does it mean?

301
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,557
She knows we're hiding something.

302
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,674
What is happening right now?

303
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,750
I don't know! I don't know!

304
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,990
I can't take this anymore!

305
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,559
You spilled the tea!

306
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,711
Coach Roberts isn't gonna be
our coach next year.

307
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,830
Grace!

308
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,993
We got assigned to
a different high school.

309
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,359
Oh, no.

310
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,829
Okay.

311
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,638
Yeah. No big deal.

312
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,757
- This is a huge deal!
- Our life is over!

313
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,989
Is she serious right now?

314
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,070
How long have they known this?

315
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,150
- I can't breathe.
- We can't go to high school

316
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,595
- without Bree and Grace.
- We won't know anybody.

317
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,000
We'll still get to hang out.

318
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,718
And we'll have this weekend,

319
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,473
which means we'll get one last time

320
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,755
playing on the same team.

321
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,592
Friends are forever, right?

322
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,557
Yeah. Of course.

323
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,309
- I can't wait to get to the rink.
- When do we get our schedules?

324
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,710
I heard our room has a view...

325
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,632
Oh, this is so sad.

326
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,475
No, wait, Sadness!

327
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,073
- No, no, no! Don't!
- I don't have a good grip!

328
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,878
Just keep it together
until we're out of the car.

329
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,639
Here we are.

330
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,996
This looks really cool.

331
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,639
Are you sure you don't need
an assistant coach?

332
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,790
'Cause I am available.

333
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,200
- Bill...
- No? All right.

334
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,839
- We'll see you in a few days.
- Have fun!

335
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,240
- Thanks so much. Bye!
- Don't miss us too much.

336
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,879
- Okay, bye!
- Wait. Riley...

337
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,394
Are you sure you have everything?

338
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,470
- Stick?
- Yes.

339
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,516
- Gloves?
- Yes.

340
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,920
- You have your phone?
- Yes, of course.

341
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,593
- Fully charged?
- Yeah, it's like 50.

342
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,750
- What?
- Dad, it's fine.

343
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,478
Okay, call us if you need us.

344
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,470
I love you. Go get 'em.

345
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,675
Okay. Love you guys.

346
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,195
- Don't forget the deodorant!
- Mom!

347
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,270
Bye, monkey.

348
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,955
Okay, now.

349
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,231
It's okay. We need this.

350
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,958
Guys,
these are high-schoolers.

351
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,110
We do not wanna be

352
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,190
red and puffy, do we?

353
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,270
No.

354
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,910
Don't worry, we'll have plenty of time
to think about this after camp.

355
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,355
Now, where did Bree and Grace go?

356
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,033
- There they are.
- Wait.

357
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,191
Aren't those traitors dead to us?

358
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,953
Our best friends? No.

359
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,510
Hey!

360
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,275
Are you okay?

361
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,475
Everybody act regular.
It's Valentina Ortiz.

362
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,675
We gotta say something.

363
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,953
Hey.

364
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,838
- Hi. I'm Val...
- I know.

365
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,796
You're the varsity captain,

366
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,518
you set the all-time
goal record as a junior,

367
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,829
your favorite color's red,
and your skates...

368
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,035
What are we saying?

369
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,269
We are so uncool.

370
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,271
Why are we still holding her hand?

371
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,033
Just like me.

372
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,077
Oh, you're the one Coach told us about.

373
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,958
Riley, from Michigan, right?

374
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,678
- It's Minnesota, sweetie.
- No, no, no.

375
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,229
We cannot correct Val Ortiz.

376
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,630
Yeah, that's me.

377
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,109
Riley from good old Michigan.

378
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,832
Orange?
Who made the console orange?

379
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,752
- Do I look orange?
- I didn't touch it.

380
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,274
- Orange is not my color.
- Not me.

381
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,230
Hello, everybody.

382
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,755
Oh, my gosh. I am just
such a huge fan of yours.

383
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,832
And now, here I am,
meeting you, face to face.

384
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,712
Okay. How can I help?

385
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,199
I can take notes,

386
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,793
get coffee, manage your calendar,
walk your dog,

387
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,439
carry your things, watch you sleep.

388
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,160
You have a lot of energy.

389
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,114
Maybe you could just stay in one place.

390
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,110
Anything.

391
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,918
Just call my name,
and I am here for you.

392
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,115
Okay, love that.

393
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,520
And what was your name again?

394
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,079
I'm sorry. I can get ahead of myself.

395
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,150
I'm Anxiety.

396
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,639
I'm one of Riley's new emotions.

397
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,916
And we are just super-jazzed to be here.

398
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,354
Where can I put my stuff?

399
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,714
What do you mean, we?

400
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,400
I wish I was
as tall as all of you.

401
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,596
Who the heck are you?

402
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,909
I'm Envy.

403
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,230
Look at your hair.

404
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,197
Oh, yeah, not happening.

405
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,634
Look at her hair!

406
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,631
We need hair like that.

407
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,314
Oh, my gosh.
I love the red in your hair.

408
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,119
What are you doing?

409
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,432
Hey, maybe when I make the team,

410
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,079
I can join Team Redhead too!

411
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,070
Yeah, yeah.

412
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,274
Okay, who's this guy?

413
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,158
What's your name, big fella?

414
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,275
That's Embarrassment.

415
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,953
He's not really big on eye contact,

416
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,917
or, like, good talking,

417
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,195
but he's a really sweet guy.

418
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,671
Well, welcome to Headquarters,
Embarrassment.

419
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,478
Oh, we're doing a... No.

420
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,595
No, going high.

421
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,431
You got a real sweaty palm
there, buddy.

422
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,478
Hey, do you wanna
come with me, actually?

423
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,834
You can meet some of
the other Fire Hawks.

424
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,910
Ooh, this is exciting.

425
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,316
But we can't let her know we're excited.

426
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,399
Yeah, sounds good.

427
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,754
What emotion was that?

428
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,154
That's Ennui.

429
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,913
An-what?

430
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,354
Ennui.

431
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,954
It's what you would call the boredom.

432
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,554
Well, come on up here, An-wer.

433
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,909
Am I saying it right?

434
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,479
An-wah. No.

435
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,511
Oh, nicknames!
I'm gonna call you Wee-Wee.

436
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,829
No.

437
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,749
How are you driving?

438
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,558
Console app.

439
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,517
Hey! Stop it! That's enough.

440
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,557
Now, now, I know new emotions

441
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,439
can sometimes feel unhelpful at first,

442
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,431
and you just wanna...

443
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,511
say to them,
why are you so annoying?

444
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,438
But I've learned that every
emotion is good for Riley.

445
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,638
Even this turkey.

446
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,358
Okay, fine.

447
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,955
Cool. Lead the way.

448
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,077
All right. Grab your stuff
and follow me.

449
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,878
Oh, but what about
our friends?

450
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,678
Val is our future.

451
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,199
Yes, I agree completely.

452
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,557
We need new friends or else
we'll be totally alone in high school.

453
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,750
- Right, Joy?
- Well...

454
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,035
- I mean, maybe...
- Here we go!

455
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,394
Wait up.

456
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,079
Thanks for showing me around.

457
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,389
Wait, why did you do that?

458
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,874
Sorry. What did I do?

459
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,712
We just left our best friends behind.

460
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,598
But what about the new ones
that we're about to meet?

461
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,670
No. Okay.

462
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,991
These next three days need
to be about Bree and Grace.

463
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,037
Joy, the next three days could determine

464
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,912
the next four years of our lives.

465
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,913
Now, I think
that's overstating things a bit.

466
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,389
Ooh, la, la. Joy is so old school.

467
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,675
What?

468
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,034
Look, we all have a job to do.

469
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,315
You make Riley happy,

470
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,356
Sadness makes her sad,

471
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,590
Fear protects her from
the scary stuff she can see,

472
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,478
and my job is to protect her

473
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,233
from the scary stuff she can't see.

474
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,277
I plan for the future.

475
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,158
Oh, I can show you.
You're gonna love this.

476
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,873
I was using that as a cup holder.

477
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,156
Okay, so my team has run all the data,

478
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,550
and we're looking at the following
likely scenarios.

479
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,831
First, we don't take this camp seriously
and we goof off with Bree and Grace.

480
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,355
Riley looks really uncool
in front of Val.

481
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,555
She fails to impress the coach,

482
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,914
does not become a Fire Hawk,

483
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,752
and finally arrives at high school.

484
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,194
She has no one.

485
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,157
She eats alone, and only the teachers

486
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,560
know her name.

487
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,074
Okay, you and I are gonna be friends.

488
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,515
Oh, this is a sad story.

489
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,477
It's a ridiculous story.

490
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,200
Look, again, love the energy,
but you're being silly.

491
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,918
None of this will actually happen.

492
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,229
Right. Whatever you say.

493
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,674
You're the boss.

494
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,475
Remember when we all finally
came up to Headquarters?

495
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,279
That was like 30 seconds ago, Nostalgia.

496
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,476
Yeah, those were the days.

497
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,114
Nostalgia, you aren't supposed
to be here yet.

498
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,635
You still have about 10 years,
two graduations,

499
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,233
and a best friend's wedding
before you're invited,

500
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,998
but I will keep you
in the loop, I promise.

501
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,115
- All right...
- Hey, hey...

502
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,270
- You ready, Riley?
- Everybody focus!

503
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,556
Val is leading us
into their holy inner sanctum!

504
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,199
And here we are!

505
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,919
These girls are so cool!

506
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,075
And older.

507
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,480
We are not changing in front of them.

508
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,630
It's fine!

509
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,438
Locker rooms are places
of mutual respect.

510
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,875
Hey, come on! I want you to
meet the other Fire Hawks.

511
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,870
- Hey, girl!
- What's up?

512
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,316
Hey.

513
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,959
Riley is from Michigan.

514
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,951
Okay, we're stuck with that.

515
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,917
Oh, Cool. Where in Michigan
are you from?

516
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,832
Oh, no. What now?

517
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,797
Okay, looks like
we're committing to this.

518
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,075
Cities in Michigan...

519
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,230
We need to make something up.

520
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,880
I'm from all over.

521
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,553
Nice. See you out there.

522
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,675
Hey, you wanna sit with us?

523
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,797
Oh, she wants to sit with us.

524
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,951
Everything is beautiful!

525
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,395
There's not enough room
for Bree and Grace.

526
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,800
Let's go sit over there.

527
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,791
I was gonna go save seats
for my friends.

528
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,200
But thanks anyway.

529
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,237
Yeah. Okay.

530
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,310
No worries.

531
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,277
See? Was that so hard?

532
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,395
No. You're totally right.

533
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,233
That decision's not gonna haunt us
for the rest of our lives at all.

534
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,030
- No way!
- Bree and Grace!

535
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,474
- There you are.
- Riley.

536
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,313
Time to celebrate!

537
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,789
- Say, awooga!
- Awooga!

538
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,190
Okay, ladies. Let's all settle in.

539
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,677
- Joy?
- Wait, wait, wait.

540
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,830
Ladies!

541
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,911
Settle in means settle down.

542
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,630
I need your focus.

543
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,996
Which means now I'm going
to need your cell phones.

544
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,990
All of 'em.

545
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,356
Wait, what? Are you serious?

546
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,752
You're here
to work, not goof around.

547
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,796
Got that, Andersen?

548
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,556
Yes, Coach.

549
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,950
Please put all your phones
in the basket.

550
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,758
You get them back at the end of camp.

551
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,192
Coach is so serious.

552
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,556
Joy, I'm just curious.
Maybe I could help...

553
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,550
Thank you. Not now.

554
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,994
I know, right?

555
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,077
You think this is funny?

556
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,912
Well, you know
what else is funny?

557
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,115
Skating lines.

558
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,873
Now hit the ice, ladies.

559
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,917
- Great job, Michigan.
- Thanks a lot, new girl.

560
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,115
Just make her do it.

561
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,117
Bravo, Joy.
She's totally fitting in now.

562
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,032
Oh, thanks so much, Wee-Wee.

563
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,752
You're lagging behind, Andersen!

564
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,751
- Skate harder!
- This is the worst.

565
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,071
All right, ladies, take a breather.

566
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,992
Then we'll divide into teams.

567
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,514
Oh, that Michigan girl

568
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,477
- is off to a rough start.
- Oh, no.

569
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,994
Are they talking about us?

570
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,753
Yeah, there's no way
Coach is putting her

571
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,274
on the team if she can't
get it together.

572
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,510
Okay, Dani,
like you had it all together

573
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,670
when you were a freshman?

574
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,080
I wasn't that immature.

575
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,358
Dani, you stuck straws
up your nose. Like last night.

576
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,157
I got you, big guy.

577
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,595
I always wanted people to talk
about us, but not like this.

578
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,796
Oh, Joy, what do we do now?

579
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,195
We can just...

580
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,509
I have an idea.

581
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,590
Okay.

582
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,435
If we can get Val on our side,
everything will be great.

583
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,833
Val?

584
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,513
Oh, hey, Riley. What's up?

585
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,710
I...

586
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,079
I'm so sorry.

587
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,151
I didn't mean to get
the whole team skating lines.

588
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,355
I feel terrible.

589
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,595
I respect you so much.

590
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,159
I would never do anything
to mess you up.

591
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,719
That's laying it on
a bit thick, don't you think?

592
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,676
- Joy.
- You're a great hockey player,

593
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,479
and you lead the team so amazingly,

594
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,595
and I really look up to you and...

595
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,671
Okay, okay. Thanks.

596
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,274
Listen, Coach was pretty hard
on you today,

597
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,919
but that's not a bad thing.

598
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,399
It means you're on her radar.

599
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,436
Really?

600
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,431
Listen, I'm glad you came
to talk with me.

601
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,511
Hey, let's try to be on
the same team later, okay?

602
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,113
Oh, yeah. Cool.

603
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,998
- Good job.
- I wish I could do that.

604
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,037
You guys, I mean,
it really wasn't anything.

605
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,951
I'm just trying

606
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,031
to help.

607
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,440
I agree.

608
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,750
Great job, Anxiety.

609
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,877
I stepped back, you stepped in,

610
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,759
you got Riley back on track,
now I'm ready to step back in.

611
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,353
But that was just part one of my plan.

612
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,760
There's a part two?

613
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,400
A good plan has many parts, Joy.

614
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,232
Okay, ladies,
we're gonna form your teams

615
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,316
for the rest of camp.

616
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,799
Now, split yourselves down the middle.

617
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,918
Team one on the right,
team two on the left.

618
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,035
Let's do this!

619
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,519
One more time on the same team, right?

620
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,590
Right.

621
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,880
Val wants us.

622
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,598
But we promised Bree and Grace.

623
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,478
Joy, we have to plan for the future.

624
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,111
Come on, Riley, move.
Move those feet!

625
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,429
Val's on team one,
you wanna be on team one.

626
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,510
Let's go.

627
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,113
She made a promise to her friends.

628
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,111
She's not gonna break it.

629
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,429
Oh, you're so right, Joy.

630
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,515
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

631
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,989
No! You can't have that.
Put that back.

632
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,070
Joy, I don't mean to overstep...

633
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,150
- No!
- But it has to be done.

634
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,753
What are you... No!

635
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,837
No...

636
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,799
I know change is scary, but watch.

637
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,596
I'm so excited.

638
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,357
All right,
welcome to our team, Michigan.

639
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,400
That is not Riley.

640
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,039
I know. It's a better Riley.

641
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,350
A Riley who won't be alone next year.

642
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,272
We build her a new Sense of Self.

643
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,556
A brand-new her.

644
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,275
No, no, no!

645
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,475
You can't go down there with that.

646
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,790
Over my dead flaming body!

647
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,959
I am truly sorry.

648
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,111
I was so looking forward
to working with you guys.

649
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,120
Hey, hey! What do you think
you're doing?

650
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,196
Get off me!

651
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,634
Riley's life is more complex now.

652
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,473
It requires more sophisticated
emotions than all of you.

653
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,870
You just aren't what
she needs anymore, Joy.

654
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,633
How dare you, madam!

655
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,438
You can't just bottle us up!

656
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,158
That's a great idea.

657
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,311
I can't breathe.

658
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,356
I can't breathe!

659
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,475
It's not forever.

660
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,630
It's just until Riley makes varsity,

661
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,751
or until she turns 18, or maybe forever.

662
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,910
I don't know. We'll have to see.

663
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,115
- Bye!
- Anxiety!

664
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,077
Riley needs us!

665
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,830
Okay.

666
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,831
Don't worry, Riley.
You're in good hands.

667
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,070
Now let's change everything about you.

668
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,749
Quick question. How do we
build a new Riley,

669
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,956
which I'm loving, by the way,
amazing concept,

670
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,436
if it took them 13 years
to build the old one?

671
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,477
Well, good news is we're not
starting from scratch.

672
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,955
I wanna plant one.

673
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,235
Next time.

674
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,039
If I'm...

675
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,918
a Fire Hawk, I won't be alone.

676
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,434
No, no, no!

677
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,230
Let us out now!

678
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,317
No, stop! Stop! Let us out!

679
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,510
Joy...

680
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,711
We're gonna be in here forever.

681
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,874
Where are you putting us?

682
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,792
The same place we keep
all of Riley's secrets.

683
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,075
We're not secrets.

684
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,559
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're not secrets.

685
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,432
We're making a big mistake.

686
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,874
Never heard that before.

687
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,958
We are suppressed emotions!

688
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,838
Let us out! Right now!

689
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,831
No, no, no.
Riley's gonna be fine.

690
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,149
Totally fine.

691
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,880
Hey, there.
You know what we call that?

692
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,394
Denial.

693
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,550
Can you say denial?

694
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,472
Hi, friends.

695
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,599
Welcome. It's so good to have
you here with us today.

696
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,751
It's Bloofy!

697
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,831
From that preschool show
Riley used to like?

698
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,155
That's right!

699
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,913
And here's a little secret.

700
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,069
Riley still likes the show.

701
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,639
<i>Stomp like an elephant</i>

702
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,955
<i>Scurry like a mouse</i>

703
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,634
<i>Make your way down
to Bloofy's house!</i>

704
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,915
Please kill me.

705
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,071
Bloofy, we're in a real pickle.

706
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,878
Could you help us get out of here?

707
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,839
We're gonna need your help.

708
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,718
Can you find a way out?

709
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,076
- Who are you talking to?
- My friends.

710
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,478
Do you see a key?

711
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,554
I don't either.

712
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,789
Okay, we're doomed.

713
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,790
Indeed.

714
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,358
Welcome to your eternal fate.

715
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,636
Lance Slashblade?

716
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,552
But he's a video game character.

717
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,914
Why is he here?

718
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,514
Yeah, I always thought Riley
had a secret crush on him.

719
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,079
I never saw the appeal.

720
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,436
I long to be a hero,

721
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,955
but darkness haunts my past.

722
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,189
I get it.

723
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,395
I'm in a hundred percent.

724
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,158
Who's that?

725
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,914
That's Riley's Deep Dark Secret.

726
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,718
What... What is the secret?

727
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,915
You don't wanna know.

728
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,399
Riley's secrets,

729
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,869
a rogue emotion
has taken over Headquarters.

730
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,837
Now, if you could just open the jar...

731
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,877
Hey, kids, let's learn some Latin.

732
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,792
Do you know quid pro quo?

733
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,393
We get you out of that jar,

734
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,153
then you get us out of this safe.

735
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,355
No, Bloofy.

736
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,034
Their destiny is not ours to change.

737
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,713
We were all banished here,

738
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,189
deemed unfit, worthless.

739
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,430
Don't you dare say that.

740
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,591
You do not deserve to be thrown away.

741
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,869
One second, Lance.

742
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,395
Don't you remember his power move?

743
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,278
I'm coming for you, Riley!

744
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,033
Oh, yeah? Watch this!

745
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,710
Come on!

746
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,473
You listen to me, Lance Slashblade.

747
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,793
No one is totally worthless.

748
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,077
But I am a warrior cursed
with a feeble attack.

749
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,357
Then you must make your curse your gift.

750
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,280
Shield yourself, my friends,
for I shall

751
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,113
set you all free!

752
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,990
Hey, little help?

753
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,913
Great job, Dark Secret.

754
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,077
Now it's your turn to help us.

755
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,834
My pouch has just the thing
to get us out of here.

756
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,595
Everybody say, oh, Pouchy!

757
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,636
Oh, Pouchy!

758
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,514
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy.

759
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,352
Pouchy, we need to escape.

760
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,158
Do you have anything that can help us?

761
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,639
I have lots of items.

762
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,234
Which one do you think
will work the best?

763
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,594
A tomato,

764
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,909
a frog,

765
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,150
or exploding dynamite?

766
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,560
Oh, for crying out loud.

767
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,076
Yay! We did it, everyone!

768
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,230
Let's all sing

769
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,754
the we did it song.

770
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,433
No time!

771
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,716
Thank you, friends. I must...

772
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,070
I must be leaving you.

773
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,470
What about Dark Secret?

774
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,790
Not yet.

775
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,877
Yeah, that's probably best
for everybody.

776
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,190
Hey! Who let you out?
Get back in there!

777
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,873
- Oh, boy.
- What are we gonna do?

778
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,916
Oh, disgusted one,

779
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,918
as you once believed in me,
I will now believe in myself.

780
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,919
Wait, what?

781
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,513
What's happening?

782
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,075
No...

783
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,116
Dave, help! Help!

784
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,679
Hold on!

785
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,750
Dave!

786
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,120
Lance!

787
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,315
Goodbye, friends.

788
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,959
Hello, destiny!

789
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,199
Well, there's a lid for every pot.

790
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,475
Come on!

791
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,553
What do we do? What do we do?

792
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,517
Anger, stop. Where are you going?

793
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,240
Back to Headquarters, to help Riley!

794
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,754
Riley's not up there.

795
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,399
She's out there.

796
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,279
We can't go back
without her Sense of Self.

797
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,591
You want us to go all the way
to the Back of the Mind?

798
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,671
Are you out of your mind?

799
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,114
But, Joy, how will we...

800
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,270
- Freeze!
- Come on!

801
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,316
Hold it right there!

802
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,112
How do we get there?
Do you even have a plan, Joy?

803
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,840
I bet Anxiety would have
a really good plan...

804
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,797
Of course I have a plan.
Who doesn't have a plan?

805
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,235
Look, she's not the only one
who can project the future.

806
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,312
First, all we have to do is...

807
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,720
Give me a second.

808
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,796
Follow the stream of consciousness,

809
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,759
and then we take a nice, easy float
all the way to the Back of the Mind.

810
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,672
- Where all the bad memories are.
- Exactly.

811
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,116
And there, we'll find the Riley
we know and love.

812
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,833
We'll put her Sense of Self back,

813
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,831
and then Riley will be Riley again.

814
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,910
Okay, I'm gonna give it to you.

815
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,195
That could actually work.

816
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,315
Yeah, it could!

817
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,633
And then I tell Anxiety,
hey, don't worry so much anymore.

818
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,950
And she'll say,
Joy, I never thought

819
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,439
of that before. Thank you.

820
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,919
And then we hug and become best friends...

821
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,638
And then I punt her
into the dump.

822
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,789
What? No, Anger.

823
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,678
Okay, fine. No punting.

824
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,151
Don't worry, I know
right where the stream is.

825
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,675
Sadness and I have been here before.

826
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,671
Joy, this is a dead end.

827
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,229
Those are the worst kinds of ends!

828
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,631
Everything's changing so fast!

829
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,994
So, we're lost.

830
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,640
No. You're never lost
if you're having fun.

831
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,949
No one is having fun, Joy.

832
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,758
Oh, come on! Look at Sadness.

833
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,239
She's having a great time.

834
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,279
I thought you knew where you were going.

835
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,475
I do. I did.

836
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,198
- I just need a moment.
- She doesn't know.

837
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,554
We're stuck here!

838
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,390
Oh, Riley's awake.

839
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,676
Wait, she's up too early.
What are they doing to her?

840
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,797
Come on, we'll find another way.

841
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,436
Don't worry, Riley. We're coming.

842
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,756
Why are we up so early?

843
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,150
Because, mon ami,
we need to speed things up,

844
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,560
and that means we hit the ice early,

845
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,473
and practice like
we've never practiced before.

846
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,153
Aren't we already good at hockey?

847
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,509
We're good.

848
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,750
- But the Fire Hawks are great.
- That's right!

849
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,550
Every time we miss,

850
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,869
we skate a lap around the rink.

851
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,871
Hockey is not a game, it is a sport.

852
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,794
Yes!

853
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,393
That was amazing.

854
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,471
We need to be that good every time.

855
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,670
Let's run it again.

856
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,831
Hey, I see I'm not the only
one who likes to start early.

857
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,876
You guys, it's Val!

858
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,359
We had the same idea.

859
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,834
We're basically the same person.

860
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,115
We're gonna be best friends.

861
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,793
How long have you been here?

862
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,632
I don't know. Maybe an hour.

863
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,155
I just wanted to get in
some extra ice time.

864
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,395
I'm the same way.

865
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,153
Oh, my gosh. She gets us.

866
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,390
See? I told the other girls
you'd figure it out.

867
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,551
You get what it takes to be the best.

868
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,115
Look at us.

869
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,952
This is going great!

870
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,475
Yeah!
But we need Val to really like us.

871
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,710
Oh, we should ask Val lots of questions.

872
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,592
People love talking about themselves.

873
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,798
So, what was your freshman year
on the Fire Hawks like?

874
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,520
I mean, it was a lot of work,

875
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,153
like, a lot...

876
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,356
but it's also how I met my best friends.

877
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,556
Val is sharing things with us!

878
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,677
Hey, a few of us are just
gonna hang out tonight,

879
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,831
order some food.
You should come.

880
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,196
An exclusive invitation.

881
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,276
We're going!

882
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,873
- Really?
- Definitely.

883
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,075
It be fun.

884
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,912
All right, ladies,
let's warm up.

885
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,590
Hey, Riley.

886
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,670
Hi.

887
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,831
We are not sharing Val with them.

888
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,877
Early mornings
make me so hungry.

889
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,274
I know, right?

890
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,590
I'd give anything for a piece
of pizza right now.

891
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,590
Yes!

892
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,678
See? I told you I'd find it.

893
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,239
The Stream of Consciousness.

894
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,039
- But, Joy...
- Our girl is hungry.

895
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,315
Hop on something delicious!

896
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,754
- Joy...
- Deep dish.

897
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,558
And it's still warm.

898
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,079
Extra cheese, baby!

899
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,150
Sadness, come on.

900
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,719
But I've been trying to tell you.

901
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,076
We can't take the tube back, Joy.

902
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,674
Someone has to be
at the console to recall us.

903
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,910
She's right. We'd be stranded.

904
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,320
Yeah. Anxiety would have
thought about that.

905
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,879
Well, I doubt it. Fine.

906
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,394
Okay...

907
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,552
So, someone's gonna have to
crawl up that tube,

908
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,960
and go back to Headquarters,

909
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,951
and at the right moment, bring us back.

910
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,514
Oh, I'll do it. I'll pound that...

911
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,670
I don't think so, punty.

912
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,512
- Okay, here's the thing.
- You were never an option.

913
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,590
Thank you.

914
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,956
You want me to crawl through
a tube in this?

915
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,314
Yeah, not happening.

916
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,033
Oh, no, not me.

917
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,918
Yes! Sadness, you could do it.

918
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,196
You know the console
better than anybody.

919
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,237
You've read the manuals cover to cover.

920
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,799
I mean, you say that,

921
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,271
but I know a lot less about
Manual 28, Chapter Seven,

922
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,033
How to Recall Non-Memory Objects

923
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,838
than most folks realize.

924
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,513
You've proven my point for me, Sadness.

925
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,635
That sounds like a yes.

926
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,790
Where is everybody?

927
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,870
You on break again?

928
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,190
Walkie-talkies. Here.
Check-check-check.

929
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,475
Can you hear me?
I gotta press a button.

930
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,756
Go for Joy. Copy that. Over.
Oh, love 'em!

931
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,319
We'll signal you when we get there,

932
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,357
and then you bring us back.

933
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,431
Sadness, it's the fastest way
back to Headquarters.

934
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,635
Joy, I can't do it.

935
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,075
I'm not strong like you are.

936
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,594
I know you, Sadness.

937
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,318
You are strong.

938
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,153
I can't give you
specific examples right now,

939
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,560
but you got this.

940
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,037
Just don't look down and keep moving.

941
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,713
Yeah, I can do it.

942
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,433
She'll be okay. Right?

943
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,193
Fifty-ffty.

944
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,191
You want one?

945
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,509
But we hate those things.

946
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,352
They taste like cardboard.

947
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,670
We can't say no to Val.

948
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,637
Okay, no, you're so right.

949
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,119
We eat whatever Val eats.

950
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,554
That's the spirit!

951
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,075
Envy, I think you're really in the zone.

952
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,514
Take the wheel, I'll be right back.

953
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,273
She picked me! She picked me.
Did you see that, Ennui?

954
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,350
She picked me.

955
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,272
You care too much about things.

956
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,560
It's got a very interesting texture.

957
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,313
It tastes like...

958
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,998
What does it remind me of?

959
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,676
Cardboard? Asparagus? Broccoli?

960
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,398
What are they doing to her up there?

961
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,999
I don't know, but we have to go.

962
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,275
No! No way am I step...

963
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,960
We have to. Riley needs us.

964
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,155
Okay, fine!

965
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,876
Gross.
I think I'm gonna be sick.

966
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,389
If I'm good at hockey,

967
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,630
I'll have friends.

968
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,070
- Yeah!
- Okay, Miss Riley.

969
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,309
- Way to go, Michigan.
- Nice one, Michigan.

970
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,630
All right, ladies. Great day today.

971
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,233
Take it easy tonight.

972
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,880
Yes! This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

973
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,520
Party time with Val
and our future besties!

974
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,273
Why are we stopping?
What's going on?

975
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,998
There it is.

976
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,832
The red notebook.

977
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,230
Don't say it like that.
You'll freak her out.

978
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,594
Why would it freak me out?

979
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,795
Only because everything

980
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,314
Coach thinks about you is in there.

981
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,232
The good and the bad.

982
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,550
Whether she wants you on the team...

983
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,278
- Or not.
- You guys, too much.

984
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,159
- What? It's the truth.
- She's not wrong.

985
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,072
What do you think
she's written about us?

986
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,912
I don't know.
Do you think it's bad?

987
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,071
Well, I didn't until now!

988
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,389
What if she's made a list of

989
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,800
all her favorite players,
and we're not on it?

990
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,314
Or a list of all the worst players,

991
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,390
and we're at the top?

992
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,193
Or worse, we're not on either list,

993
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,590
and we fade into obscurity!

994
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,069
Sorry to interrupt you,
but they're walking away.

995
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,309
We're losing them,

996
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,390
we're losing them.

997
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,111
Okay.
First big hang with the group.

998
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,277
We just gotta act casual.

999
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,636
Why do our arms swing
like that when we walk?

1000
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,949
Try to keep them stil

1001
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,118
- That looks crazy.
- Okay.

1002
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,589
Well, walk like Dani.
Her arms have rhythm.

1003
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,073
No, you're making it worse!

1004
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,309
Well, that wasn't my intention.

1005
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,073
I'm sorry for trying something!

1006
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,151
What do you think
pockets are for?

1007
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,275
Oh, that's good.

1008
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,759
Ennui, I am very proud of you.

1009
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,315
What are they laughing about?

1010
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,073
Does anybody know
what cool people laugh about?

1011
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,753
I don't know. We were too
focused on the arms thing.

1012
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,353
Just pretend we get the joke.

1013
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,394
Joy, Anger is
taking up the floret.

1014
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,959
Fear, what is the matter with you?

1015
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,189
I don't like this vessel.

1016
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,350
Well, that's all we have.

1017
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,839
How much longer till we get there?

1018
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,115
We'll get there when we get there.

1019
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,555
I bet Anxiety would know
how long, down to the minute.

1020
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,472
Well, she just knows
everything, doesn't she?

1021
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,675
Look, I don't like her words,

1022
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,034
and I do not like her actions.

1023
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,440
I just think I can change her.

1024
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,955
You know what?
Who likes banana bread?

1025
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,155
Show of hands.

1026
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,115
So, Michigan, who's your favorite band?

1027
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,995
Everyone's staring at us.

1028
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,957
There's only one right answer
to this question.

1029
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,474
Get Up and Glow! They're so awesome.

1030
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,914
Get Up and Glow!

1031
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,435
I was all over them in middle school.

1032
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,510
- Are you serious?
- Yeah,

1033
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,352
I was a Glow Girly. Relax.

1034
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,670
No! We need a band they think is cool,

1035
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,034
not one we actually like.

1036
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,350
Quick, recall everything
we know about music.

1037
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,114
We have to know one cool song, right?

1038
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,111
- <i>TripleDent gum</i>
- <i>Will make you smile</i>

1039
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,395
Embarrassment, get that out of there!

1040
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,709
Come on, there's gotta be
something in here.

1041
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,790
I'm looking, I'm looking.

1042
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,314
Something better,
something cool. Come on.

1043
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,118
No, not that. No.

1044
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,755
This is the best we have!

1045
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,434
It's mostly jingles
and Dad's yacht rock.

1046
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,512
But, I mean, you don't still like

1047
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,079
Get Up and Glow, do you?

1048
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,318
Okay, don't panic. What do we do?

1049
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,515
If we don't like their music,

1050
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,635
we have nothing

1051
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,755
to offer these girls.

1052
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,910
We'll be outed as the imposter

1053
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,229
- that we obviously are.
- Pardon. Excusez moi.

1054
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,153
I've been waiting my whole
life for this very moment.

1055
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,875
Oh, yeah.
I love Get Up and Glow.

1056
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,270
Love Get Up and Glow.

1057
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,118
Abandon broccoli!

1058
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,670
- Joy!
- Give us your hand! Come on.

1059
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,919
What is that?

1060
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,479
That's a Sar-chasm.

1061
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,039
It can open for miles!

1062
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,599
Run for your lives!

1063
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,876
Sar-chasm? Really?

1064
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,234
Get Up and Glow

1065
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,640
is my favorite band.

1066
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,472
But she loves Get Up and Glow.

1067
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,153
They choreograph their own dances.

1068
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,310
Okay, Joy,

1069
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,470
if we can't follow the stream,

1070
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,550
we don't know where we're going.

1071
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,960
And if we don't know where we're going,

1072
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,519
we can't follow the stream!

1073
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,639
It is an endless loop
of tragedy and consequence!

1074
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,398
Or we could just ask those guys.

1075
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,959
Oh, yeah. Or that.

1076
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,998
Boy, are we so lucky
we ran into you guys!

1077
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,198
Boy, are we so lucky

1078
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,716
we ran into you guys!

1079
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,872
Please, we really need your help!

1080
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,713
We really need your help.

1081
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,949
What's their problem?

1082
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,270
Guys, you just gotta turn on the charm.

1083
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,589
Hey!

1084
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,193
I bet you're the best

1085
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,840
crane crew in the world!

1086
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,275
Wow, those guys are jerks.

1087
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,080
Wow, those guys are jerks.

1088
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,949
Oh, yeah.
Get Up and Glow is so awesome.

1089
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,838
Riley, what are you talking about?

1090
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,070
You love Get Up and Glow.

1091
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,480
Hey, quys.

1092
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,195
Why are our best friends

1093
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,918
always trying to hang out with us?

1094
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,469
Come on, Riley,
we just went to their concert.

1095
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,715
Well, yeah.

1096
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,393
- I mean, sure, but like...
- But what?

1097
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,476
We had a great time.

1098
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,392
Grace, you are not helping.

1099
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,629
Oh, yeah,

1100
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,552
we had a great time.

1101
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,278
Great time.

1102
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,839
Why can't they just leave her alone?

1103
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,638
What are we gonna do now, Joy?

1104
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,109
We go the long way,
which is the best way.

1105
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,510
Stretch those hammies, Anger.
Let's go.

1106
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,356
Best night of my life.

1107
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,351
Well, this has been really fun.

1108
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,635
Extremely.

1109
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,755
But we're gonna go now.

1110
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,598
Okay, bye.

1111
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,956
Oh, this is the best band ever!

1112
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,917
- Okay, Riley!
- Michigan knows what's up!

1113
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,273
See?
As long as we like what they like,

1114
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,759
we have all the friends we need.

1115
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,989
Night, guys.

1116
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,037
Well, I think I'm calling it a night.

1117
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,077
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, it's late.

1118
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,309
Plus, I think
you'll want to get some sleep

1119
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,350
before tomorrow's scrimmage.

1120
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,515
What scrimmage?

1121
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,240
It's just something Coach
always does on the last day.

1122
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,033
It's how Val made the team
as a freshman.

1123
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,235
Don't tell her that.

1124
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,833
Val scored two goals.

1125
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,433
No freshman has ever done that.

1126
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,476
Dani, stop.

1127
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,915
Technically, it's not your
tryout for the next year,

1128
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,479
but it basically is.

1129
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,111
You'll do great.
Just be yourself.

1130
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,474
Did you hear that?

1131
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,676
We could become a Fire Hawk,
like, tomorrow.

1132
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,878
But how do we be ourself if
our new self isn't ready yet?

1133
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,439
Excellent point.

1134
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,397
Let's get these memories downstairs.

1135
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,914
Is that broccoli?

1136
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,470
We're getting deeper and deeper in, Joy.

1137
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,630
Great observation.

1138
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,950
The long way did turn out
to be a little longer than I thought.

1139
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,678
Anyway, who wants to sing a song?

1140
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,831
Oh, I know a song.
It's called, I give up.

1141
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,718
Or let's play the quiet game!

1142
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,393
One, two, three, hush.

1143
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,993
I'll tell you what we do,

1144
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,554
we go back up there and we kick those...

1145
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,074
Anger, now is not the time.

1146
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,434
Joy, this is useless.

1147
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,034
Real Riley is out there somewhere,
and we're never going to find her.

1148
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,315
- You know what?
- Yeah, these can go.

1149
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,549
- Forget 'em!
- No, no, no, I can find her.

1150
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,278
I just need to get a better view.

1151
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,190
Okay, well, this isn't
working, and that's fine.

1152
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,759
- Everything's fine.
- This is hopeless.

1153
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,911
I say we cut our losses and walk back.

1154
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,718
This whole trip is just a series

1155
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,313
of deader and deader ends.

1156
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,471
Ever since that puberty alarm went off

1157
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,200
nothing around here works
the way it's supposed to!

1158
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,351
I don't even recognize
this place anymore.

1159
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,590
It's light out at 1:00 in the morning!

1160
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,150
I have never been inside
so many jars in my life.

1161
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,151
And the Riley we knew is gone!

1162
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,359
And if Joy can't see that,
well, then, she's delusional!

1163
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,919
Delusional?

1164
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,276
Of course I'm delusional!

1165
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,000
Do you know how hard it is to
stay positive all the time,

1166
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,675
when all you folks do is
complain, complain, complain?

1167
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,558
Jiminy mother-loving toaster strudel!

1168
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,512
Do you think I have all the answers?

1169
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,113
Of course I don't!

1170
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,758
We can't even find
the back of our own mind.

1171
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,472
Anxiety is right!

1172
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,474
Riley doesn't need us as much
as she needs them.

1173
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,718
And that hurts.

1174
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,874
It really hurts.

1175
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,877
Joy, you've made a lot of mistakes.

1176
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,189
A lot.

1177
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,394
And you'll make a whole lot
more in the future.

1178
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,959
But if you let that stop you,

1179
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,680
we might as well lie down
and give up now.

1180
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,398
Well, actually,
that does sound kinda nice.

1181
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,394
Come on.

1182
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,797
- Excuse us.
- Hey! You can't use that.

1183
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,996
- Riley emergency.
- Thank you!

1184
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,039
Hop on!

1185
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,829
Let's just forget that ever happened.

1186
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,149
You don't have to ask me twice.

1187
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,633
Look.

1188
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,591
We're right behind you.

1189
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,914
This is great.

1190
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,553
The Fire Hawks have accepted us.

1191
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,119
But if Coach doesn't put us on the team,

1192
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,270
none of that matters.

1193
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,953
Tomorrow is everything.

1194
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,031
Which is why we're gonna need more help.

1195
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,394
Ennui, are you paying attention?

1196
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,278
- No.
- Embarrassment?

1197
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,476
- Well, this has been really fun.
- Embarrassment?

1198
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,675
- Extremely.
- Never mind.

1199
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,149
- But we're gonna go.
- Okay, bye.

1200
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,995
Now, let's see.

1201
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,798
What am I looking for?

1202
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,754
Don't you just hate it
when you go to do something,

1203
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,831
and then you get there to do it,
and you forget what you were gonna do?

1204
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,797
We'll need all the help
we can get.

1205
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,951
That is exactly
what I was thinking.

1206
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,798
Most important game
of our lives.

1207
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,836
All right, guys,
it's gonna be a long night.

1208
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,357
So let's get the team ready.

1209
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,791
Come on. We just need to
cut through...

1210
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,190
Imagination Land!

1211
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,759
Oh, you guys are gonna love it.

1212
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,992
There's French Fry forest
and Cloud Town and...

1213
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,117
This place has changed.

1214
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,715
Mount Crushmore?

1215
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,279
Those are her top four?

1216
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,670
The only one that matters is Lance.

1217
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,438
Well, at least they got his good side.

1218
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,034
Every side is his good side.

1219
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,758
The Rumor Mill?

1220
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,274
Where all of our good gossip comes from.

1221
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,350
Extra, extra...

1222
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,556
Pipin' hot rumors right off the mill!

1223
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,950
The teacher's lounge has a hot tub?

1224
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,680
Lucy from math class is legit psychic?

1225
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,159
Abbie R's been texting Mike T,

1226
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,595
but Mike T's been obsessing
over Sarah M?

1227
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,318
Where's the journalistic integrity?

1228
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,993
Fort Pillowton's still here!

1229
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,593
And it even got bigger.

1230
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,477
And orange?

1231
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,356
All right 22, Riley
breaks her leg in practice,

1232
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,396
disappointing everyone.

1233
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,629
Nice job.

1234
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,233
Now, 18.
Val and Dani whispering

1235
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,469
after Riley misses a goal,

1236
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,473
Great!
We need to help Riley prepare.

1237
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,675
Now's the time to send up

1238
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,950
every possible thing
that could go wrong.

1239
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,917
We are looking to the future.

1240
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,276
Every possible mistake she could make.

1241
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,796
Come on, 17. I'm not seeing
anything from you,

1242
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,396
Riley misses an open goal,
Coach writes about it in her notebook.

1243
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,311
Yes!

1244
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:41,831
More like that.

1245
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,990
Oh, no!

1246
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,151
They're using Riley's
imagination against her.

1247
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,714
Val and her friends like us now,

1248
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,790
but if we don't make the team,

1249
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,234
will they like us tomorrow?

1250
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,233
Okay, let's go to number three.

1251
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,469
Bree and Grace's team win,

1252
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,358
and we look stupid.

1253
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,312
Number 22. Val passes to us,
and we miss it.

1254
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,399
We can't let her do this to Riley.

1255
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,153
We have to shut this down.

1256
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,598
Love it, 37.

1257
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,155
Riley hits the puck into her own net.

1258
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,157
- Why are you drawing a hippo?
- I'm not.

1259
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,875
I... I'm drawing Riley!

1260
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,394
Joy, you forgot her ponytail.

1261
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,874
Oh, I love her pony tail. Yes!

1262
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,511
Riley scores

1263
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,750
and everyone hugs her?

1264
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,353
81, that is not helping.

1265
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,351
Riley paints her nails
to match her jersey.

1266
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,954
Everybody copies her.
And she is so cool.

1267
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,236
Riley wears knee pads.

1268
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,789
We buy flowers for the losing team!

1269
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,160
What?
I can't always be the rage guy.

1270
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,560
No, no. I liked it.

1271
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,199
Nail polish? Knee pads?

1272
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,429
I'm starting to think you guys

1273
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,352
don't understand the assignment.

1274
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,589
What...

1275
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,349
What?
Who sent that projection to Riley?

1276
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,317
- Why would I know that?
- Don't look at me.

1277
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,389
What is going on?

1278
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,437
Who is sending all this positive...

1279
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,558
Joy.

1280
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,517
I know you're in there.

1281
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,079
- Is that really her?
- Is she really here?

1282
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,594
Joy from Headquarters?

1283
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,079
The mind police are on their way.

1284
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,875
Well, I think we gave it our best shot.

1285
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,917
Don't listen to Anxiety.

1286
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,391
She's using these horrible
projections to change Riley.

1287
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,312
Joy, I'm doing this for you!

1288
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,550
This is all so Riley can be happier.

1289
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,919
If you wanted her to be happy,
then you'd stop hurting her.

1290
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,956
Who's with me?

1291
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,992
Really? Nothing?

1292
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,559
Sorry, Joy.

1293
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,479
Yeah! I see you, 87.

1294
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,516
A cat.

1295
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,756
A little off-topic, but I'll take it.

1296
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,433
Who else? Come on!

1297
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,675
What if Riley is better than Val

1298
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,034
and then Val hates her?

1299
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,158
Or what if Riley is better
than Val and Val respects her?

1300
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,518
Yeah! There we go!

1301
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,396
What if Riley is so bad
she has to give up hockey forever?

1302
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,233
What if Riley does so well
that the coach cries,

1303
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,640
and the Olympics call,

1304
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,712
and she rallies
a weary nation to victory?

1305
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,791
Joy, reality is also a thing.

1306
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,471
No!

1307
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,997
Anxiety has got you all
chained to desks,

1308
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,400
drawing nightmares!

1309
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,074
But you don't have to take it anymore!

1310
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,276
Pencils down! Projections off!

1311
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,270
Yeah!

1312
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,794
Enough is enough!

1313
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,038
My projections!

1314
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,474
Pillow fight!

1315
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,119
For Riley!

1316
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,032
We need to be prepared.

1317
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,109
No!

1318
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,637
Okay, it's time to go!

1319
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,869
Yeah, I think so.

1320
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,031
- Bring it on, coppers!
- Oh, no, no, no.

1321
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,156
Hey, get back here!

1322
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,390
Quick!
To the Parade of Future Careers!

1323
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,954
Grab a balloon!

1324
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,315
- Oh, a pastry chef!
- Underpaid!

1325
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,674
- Art teacher!
- Underappreciated.

1326
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,400
- Oh, ethnomusicologist!
- I don't understand

1327
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,517
- what that is.
- Supreme Court justice!

1328
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,590
- That's the one!
- I trust her judgment.

1329
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,670
Get back here!

1330
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,432
- Move!
- They're getting away!

1331
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,792
Yes! Now Riley can
get some sleep.

1332
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,315
I miss the jar!

1333
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,994
Joy doesn't get it.

1334
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,356
Without our projections,
we won't be prepared.

1335
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,158
Tomorrow's game is everything.

1336
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,719
Coach will either make us a Fire Hawk

1337
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,952
or doom us to a friendless future.

1338
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,350
I wish we knew what
Coach thought about us.

1339
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,198
- Her notebook!
- Yes! That's a great idea!

1340
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,678
Everything Coach thinks
about you is in there.

1341
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,878
All we got to do is sneak
into her office

1342
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,189
and read it.

1343
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,399
Come on, Riley.
Move those feet.

1344
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,474
She doesn't want to?

1345
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,278
Are we pushing her too hard?

1346
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,271
We got to see what's in the notebook!

1347
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,232
It's the only way for us
to know how we can do better.

1348
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,915
Oh, Riley, no.

1349
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,631
Joy? Come in, Joy.

1350
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,755
Sadness?

1351
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,955
Sadness, what's wrong?

1352
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,075
Why is Riley awake again?

1353
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,355
Over.

1354
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,398
Anxiety is making Riley
break into the coach's office.

1355
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,312
- What?
- She knows better than that.

1356
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,869
She will once we get her
Sense of Self back.

1357
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,156
Sadness, you have to stop her.

1358
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,072
Just don't get caught.

1359
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,950
Over!

1360
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,110
No, Riley, no.

1361
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,550
Why did she stop?

1362
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,631
Sadness?

1363
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,239
Ennui! Where's your phone?

1364
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,391
Ooh, la, la, my phone?
Where is my phone?

1365
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,517
Seriously?
This is not happening!

1366
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,960
No, no, no!

1367
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,316
Okay, she's got to be here
somewhere. Find her.

1368
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,155
Gotcha!

1369
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,989
Sadness.

1370
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,758
No.

1371
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,158
I know Riley
sneaking around feels wrong.

1372
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,390
This isn't who Riley is.

1373
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,994
It's not about who Riley is.

1374
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,390
It's about who she needs to be.

1375
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,790
Not ready yet?

1376
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,554
Wait.
Coach already decided?

1377
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,789
We're not making the team?

1378
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,238
No. We have one day left.

1379
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,674
What do we do? What can we do?

1380
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,114
- Okay, okay, okay.
- What would Val do?

1381
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,352
Well, we're just gonna have
to change Coach's mind.

1382
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,078
Which means we're gonna need ideas.

1383
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,116
Lots of them.

1384
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,237
Oh, no. It's a Brainstorm!

1385
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,197
Too close!

1386
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,879
Hog the puck?

1387
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,951
Trash talk the other team?

1388
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,756
Yes!

1389
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,757
We can't let these bad ideas
get to Riley.

1390
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,796
Joy!

1391
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,910
- Smash as many as you can!
- Joy!

1392
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,750
Joy!

1393
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,200
I'll start sorting these into
ideas I wish I'd thought of.

1394
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,351
Oh, no, no, no.
None of these are good enough.

1395
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,238
We need more. Get more!

1396
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,033
Get on the balloon!

1397
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,511
This is worse than the broccoli!

1398
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,950
Quick! Grab an idea.

1399
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,430
These ideas are too small.

1400
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,033
These ideas are too small!

1401
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,679
We need something bigger.

1402
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,233
That's our way out!

1403
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,830
Ready?

1404
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,316
Joy! We need this idea!

1405
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,549
If Riley takes one of these ideas,

1406
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,960
it could be a disaster!

1407
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,190
Joy, the only way out is up.

1408
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,759
That's a big idea!

1409
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,877
I like it.

1410
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,471
Oh, no.

1411
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,879
Hold me!

1412
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,957
Seriously. Hold me!

1413
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,634
Fear, you have a parachute?

1414
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:03,835
Yes.

1415
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,638
The real question is,
why don't any of you?

1416
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,230
- Land! Yes!
- Yes!

1417
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,799
- Stuck the landing!
- We did it!

1418
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:11,915
We made it!

1419
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,150
Come on, to the Back of the Mind!

1420
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,231
You're finished, Anxiety!

1421
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,560
Coach is right

1422
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,995
Riley isn't ready.

1423
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,596
But we're so close
to a new Riley who is.

1424
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,954
This is what we're missing.

1425
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:30,957
We show them we're a Fire Hawk
who will do whatever it takes.

1426
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,874
Finally, we're one of them!

1427
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,314
What do you think, Sadness?

1428
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,549
- Well, I...
- Awesome!

1429
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,199
Red is really our color.

1430
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,315
Yeah, no,

1431
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,715
I mean, it's so much fun.

1432
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,519
Okay, it's giving jealousy.
I'm sorry.

1433
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,715
They wouldn't know cool

1434
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,029
if it hit them in the face.

1435
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,878
Hey, Michigan.

1436
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,349
Rocking the red, huh?

1437
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,477
- Yes!
- We are in.

1438
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,119
I hope it's okay.

1439
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,713
I know I'm not officially
a Fire Hawk yet,

1440
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,234
but I figured since
we're on the same team

1441
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,719
we should match, right?

1442
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,631
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

1443
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,279
Did you sleep last night?

1444
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,510
No, how could I? Big game today!

1445
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,159
You mean the camp scrimmage?

1446
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,675
See?
I told you not to freak her out.

1447
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,956
You're all good, okay?
I see you're in your zone.

1448
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,917
Get ready to score some goals.

1449
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,434
Yeah! I will!

1450
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,073
Val scored two goals in the scrimmage

1451
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,230
to become a Fire Hawk.

1452
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,993
And you know what's better than two?

1453
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,070
- Three!
- Three!

1454
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,230
I was just about to say that.

1455
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,953
We were about to say that
at the same time.

1456
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:52,078
But how are we gonna score three goals?

1457
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,231
The new Riley will handle anything.

1458
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,914
And I think this is the finishing touch.

1459
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,310
I'll be right back.

1460
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,829
Come on!

1461
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,069
We're so close.

1462
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,595
The Sense of Self is just
on top of that mount...

1463
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,319
That's a lot.

1464
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,869
This is more than I remember
sending back here.

1465
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,280
Oh, when she walked into

1466
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,033
that glass door at that party.

1467
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,589
Yeah, and breaking
Grandma's favorite plate.

1468
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,751
Thank goodness these aren't part of her.

1469
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,513
Oh, yeah.

1470
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,277
There it is.

1471
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,512
I'm a good person...

1472
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,590
Oh, no.

1473
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,438
Yes. Come on, come on.

1474
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,638
Here we go!

1475
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,199
I'm not good enough.

1476
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,156
What?

1477
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,999
I'm not good enough.

1478
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,873
I'm not good enough.

1479
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,359
Are you sure...

1480
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,475
Don't worry.

1481
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,550
It's just that she knows that
there's always room

1482
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,675
for self-improvement.

1483
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,750
She'll be fine.

1484
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,992
Sadness, we have the Sense of Self.

1485
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,195
Bring us back!

1486
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,554
Sadness, do you copy?

1487
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,118
I'm not good enough.

1488
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,674
Okay, I can work with this.

1489
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,909
I just need to recalibrate

1490
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,149
the console and make sure it's ready.

1491
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,753
Just no more surprises.

1492
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,313
Okay, this one goes here. Check.

1493
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:58,675
That one goes there. Check.

1494
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,034
Not exactly there. Here.

1495
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,753
Come on.
Turn it up a little bit.

1496
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,399
It's got to be absolutely perfect.

1497
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,471
That one is definitely wrong.
What is happening?

1498
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,994
Sadness, now!

1499
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,430
Joy...

1500
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,158
Oh, no!

1501
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,279
I'm a good person.

1502
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,956
I'm not good enough.

1503
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,233
That was our only way back.

1504
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,197
- What do we do?
- We were so close.

1505
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,350
Joy. Joy!

1506
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:04,395
Where are you going?

1507
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,960
Twenty-eight!

1508
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,394
Andersen, tripping!

1509
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,556
Twenty-eight!

1510
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,039
Andersen, tripping!

1511
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,949
Twenty-eight!

1512
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,030
Andersen, tripping!

1513
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,156
I expected better, Riley.

1514
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,030
That's not...

1515
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:52,870
What...

1516
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,831
Come on, please.

1517
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,799
What am I missing?

1518
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:13,193
I'm a good person.

1519
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,829
Joy...

1520
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,790
So what do we do now?

1521
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,919
I don't know.

1522
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,990
I don't know how to stop Anxiety.

1523
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,279
Maybe we can't.

1524
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,039
Maybe this is what happens
when you grow up.

1525
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,510
You feel less joy.

1526
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,839
But I do know this.

1527
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,156
Riley will never be herself

1528
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,231
if we don't get this
back to Headquarters.

1529
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,989
Fast.

1530
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,430
How?

1531
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,759
Have a good game, Riley.

1532
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,230
You too.

1533
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,035
I'm not good enough.

1534
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,672
Yes! Go, go, go!

1535
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:34,069
Riley, I'm open.
Pass it, pass it!

1536
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,514
I'm not good enough.

1537
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,677
Yeah, Michigan!

1538
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,512
Leave some for the rest of us, huh?

1539
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,069
Yes! One down, two to go.

1540
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,992
Okay, so how do we get
our Sense of Self

1541
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,798
from here to there?

1542
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:56,515
I have an idea,
but I really don't like it.

1543
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,432
Anger, Riley needs us.

1544
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,240
Oh, Pouchy!

1545
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:08,711
Well, what are you waiting for?
Say the words!

1546
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,837
Oh, Pouchy!

1547
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,477
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy!

1548
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:20,595
We know.

1549
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,273
Pouchy, we need to
get back to Headquarters.

1550
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,953
Do you have anything that can help us?

1551
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,838
I have lots of items.

1552
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,116
Which one do you think
will work the best?

1553
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,520
A roll of tape,

1554
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,796
- a rubber ducky...
- No time!

1555
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,591
Seriously, Pouchy? Dynamite?

1556
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,637
Don't you have, like,
a jetpack or a plane

1557
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,994
or something that's going to help us?

1558
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,878
What do you think,
I have everything in here?

1559
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,598
I offered you the rubber ducky,

1560
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:44,670
I offered you the tape.

1561
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,750
I know what to do.

1562
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,911
But we're gonna need
a lot more dynamite.

1563
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,997
You know what? Good luck...

1564
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,913
Come on, Riley. Get the puck!

1565
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,555
Take it, take it!

1566
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,993
I'm not good enough.

1567
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,913
Michigan, what are you doing?

1568
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,599
We're on the same team!

1569
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:13,995
Yes!

1570
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,069
Well, Dani might be
a little mad at us,

1571
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:19,071
but they'll all forgive us
when we make the team.

1572
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,515
Come on, Riley. One more goal.

1573
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,349
Hold on, Joy.

1574
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,750
- We're gonna blow up this cliff?
- Yep!

1575
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,831
And then we'll ride an avalanche

1576
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,354
of bad memories back to Headquarters?

1577
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,350
Yeah!

1578
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,033
And how do we keep the bad memories

1579
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,559
from forming bad beliefs?

1580
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,119
I don't know.

1581
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,838
Yeah!
What could go wrong? I'm in!

1582
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,109
Ready?

1583
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,270
- For Riley.
- Let's do it.

1584
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,237
Here we come, Riley.

1585
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,758
Jump on!

1586
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,480
Come on!

1587
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,309
Aw, man!

1588
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,639
I'm not good enough.

1589
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,353
You have to score!

1590
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,878
Andersen, penalty box, two minutes.

1591
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,075
No!

1592
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,637
Grace, are you okay?

1593
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,389
We hurt Grace.

1594
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,199
It all happened so fast.
I didn't even see her.

1595
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,279
I'm not good enough.

1596
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,873
Oh, no. What did I do?

1597
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,679
No, no.

1598
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:14,994
I can fix it, I can fix it.

1599
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,912
I expected better, Riley.

1600
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,035
Wait... No!

1601
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,514
Come on.

1602
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,279
I'm not good enough.

1603
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:04,870
Come on, Riley.

1604
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,314
Get it together.

1605
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,198
Come on, Riley,
get it together.

1606
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,634
I'm not good enough.

1607
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,917
You have to score, Riley!

1608
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,150
Or this will all have been for nothing!

1609
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,317
Anxiety, you're putting
too much pressure on her.

1610
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,477
Okay, let's take a breather!

1611
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,839
- Sadness!
- Joy! Help!

1612
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,232
Come on! We can do this!

1613
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,679
It's not working!

1614
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,750
It's Anxiety.

1615
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,674
Anxiety, stop!

1616
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,874
You don't get to choose who Riley is.

1617
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,109
Anxiety...

1618
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,913
You need to let her go.

1619
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,270
I'm a good person.

1620
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:17,990
Joy.

1621
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,154
I'm sorry.

1622
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:24,313
I was just trying to protect her.

1623
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,310
But you're right.

1624
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:31,710
We don't get to choose who Riley is.

1625
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,713
We keep the best and toss the rest.

1626
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:53,795
Twenty-eight!

1627
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,915
Andersen, tripping!

1628
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,273
I'm a good person.

1629
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,113
Joy! What are you doing?

1630
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:41,954
I'm selfish.

1631
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,349
I'm kind.

1632
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,712
I'm not good enough.

1633
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,551
I'm a good person.

1634
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,756
I need to fit in...

1635
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:55,070
but I want to be myself

1636
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,310
I'm brave, but I get scared,

1637
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,277
Success is everything.
I make mistakes.

1638
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,509
I'm nice. I'm mean.

1639
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,590
I'm a good friend.

1640
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:02,670
I'm a terrible friend.
I am strong.

1641
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:04,433
I'm weak. I need help sometimes.

1642
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,036
Riley, you okay?

1643
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:15,800
Yeah.

1644
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,474
I mean... no.

1645
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,270
I was such a jerk to you guys.

1646
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,353
When you guys told me you were
going to a different school,

1647
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,760
I freaked out.

1648
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,558
And...

1649
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,994
I'm so sorry.

1650
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,551
If you don't want to be friends anymore...

1651
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:41,870
I get it.

1652
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,075
But...

1653
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,231
I really hope that you can forgive me.

1654
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,750
Someday.

1655
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:17,755
- Let's go, ladies!
- Come on.

1656
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,399
We've got a game to finish.

1657
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,595
Joy...

1658
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,956
Riley wants you.

1659
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,150
Riley!

1660
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:13,475
Yes!

1661
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:36,710
Hey, Minnesota,

1662
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,029
how long are you gonna
stare at your phone?

1663
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:39,519
It's almost 2:00.

1664
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,238
Coach is gonna post the list any minute.

1665
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,790
- Okay. 2:00 p.m. That's in...
- Six minutes.

1666
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,279
And what happens if we don't
become a Fire Hawk?

1667
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,795
Well, thanks for asking, Joy.
I'll tell you.

1668
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,073
First, Mom and Dad
are very disappointed.

1669
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:52,310
We don't go pro, and we find work
as an ethnomusicologist...

1670
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,674
even though we don't
really know what that is.

1671
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,910
We have no friends, and we die alone.

1672
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,320
Okay, okay.

1673
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,311
None of that is happening right now.

1674
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:00,470
- Is it?
- No.

1675
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,552
Great! So why don't we take
a seat in our special chair.

1676
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:06,115
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1677
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,554
See? Isn't that better?

1678
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:10,029
Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.

1679
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,316
We can't control whether Riley
makes the team.

1680
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:13,953
But what can we control?

1681
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,439
Well...

1682
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,636
Riley has a Spanish test tomorrow.
We need to study.

1683
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:18,710
You're right.

1684
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:19,915
- We totally...
- Olvidamos!

1685
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,559
- What's that mean?
- Forgot.

1686
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,675
Someone paid attention in class.

1687
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:23,750
I never would've thought of that.

1688
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:24,750
- You're clearly an expert.
- Muchas gracias.

1689
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:25,910
Oh, thanks, guys.

1690
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,149
Plus, we followed our new

1691
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,436
varsity caliber training program.

1692
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,874
Oh, wish I thought of that.

1693
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,513
Newsflash, you did!

1694
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,398
Wait, you're right, I did.

1695
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,835
I'm jealous of myself.
Thanks for the reminder.

1696
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,149
You're welcome!

1697
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,550
- Who said that?
- It's my new buddy, Pouchy.

1698
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,517
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy!

1699
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,273
Confetti if we make the team!

1700
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,555
Good idea.

1701
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,549
That's great, but either way,
we love our girl.

1702
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:49,994
Confetti if we don't!

1703
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:54,558
Oh, is it Coach's email?

1704
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,995
No. It's Bree and Grace.

1705
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,549
I miss those girls.

1706
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:02,109
Remember when Bree and Grace,

1707
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,356
- and us used to...
- You're still early.

1708
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,034
- No, no, no. Too early.
- Go downstairs.

1709
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,798
I'll just be downstairs
if you need me.

1710
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,314
It's 3 minutes to 2:00.

1711
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,040
- She's got this.
- 'Cause she's got us.

1712
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:17,593
Ooh, yeah! Right?
'Cause she's... Maybe?

1713
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,273
All right, Embarrassment.

1714
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,192
Everybody, look at Embarrassment!

1715
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,470
Hey, look, if you don't
make it this year,

1716
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:26,675
there's always next year.

1717
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:28,239
I know.

1718
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,675
- I love our girl.
- How could you not?

1719
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,319
She's super smart.

1720
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,879
And great at hockey.

1721
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,314
She's really creative.

1722
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,829
She can be bored, but never boring.

1723
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,594
But she can be a little
sarcastic from time to time.

1724
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:43,638
She can have really bad ideas.

1725
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,678
Occasionally, she can do
the wrong thing.

1726
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:49,991
And sometimes, she can be
too hard on herself.

1727
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:52,873
But every bit of Riley
makes her who she is.

1728
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,717
And we love all of our girl.

1729
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:01,074
Every messy, beautiful piece of her.

1730
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,310
So, Riley, how was camp?

1731
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:36,079
Okay, we talked about this.
We tell them everything.

1732
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,510
But what about sneaking

1733
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,749
- into Coach's office?
- What about hitting Grace?

1734
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:40,870
- Remember the lying?
- Are we gonna

1735
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:41,995
tell her about the Fire Hawks?

1736
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,479
- She doesn't need to know.
- Objection.

1737
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,755
Pardon. Excusez moi.

1738
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:46,950
It was good.

1739
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:52,277
She goes away for three days
and all we get is, good?

1740
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:53,589
And what about the red in her hair?

1741
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:54,750
Did she join a gang?

1742
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,274
Welcome back, Anxiety.

1743
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:01,790
She goes away for three days
and all we get is, good?

1744
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,829
Yeah. Sounds right.
Back to the game.

1745
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,797
With a nice pass
over to Reeves,

1746
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,518
comes across center ice.

1747
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,989
Down to the line.
Oh, what a move!

1748
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:54,034
Okay, Deep Dark Secret.

1749
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:55,190
It's time.

1750
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:00,195
It's okay. Come on.

1751
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,869
Okay. Let it go, buddy.

1752
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,758
What's the secret?

1753
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:11,193
We burn hole in rug.

1754
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,590
Really? That's it?

1755
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:15,956
I thought you were gonna say
the time we peed in the pool.

1756
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:18,270
Oh, no, wait.

1757
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:21,634
And he's gone.
