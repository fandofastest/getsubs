01:24:11,416 --> 01:24:12,541
Hey, you!

2
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:17,291
Pay attention to the customers!
Your job is to fuck the clients.

3
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,875
He's disgusting.

4
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:26,291
Who do you think you are?

5
01:24:26,375 --> 01:24:28,875
Queen Meeru?

6
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,041
I'm not going to hurt you.

7
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:05,291
You're far from home and so am I.

8
01:43:06,541 --> 01:43:08,583
You and I...

9
01:43:09,875 --> 01:43:11,041
...we are alike.

10
01:43:13,041 --> 01:43:14,708
We've been hurt...

11
01:43:14,791 --> 01:43:17,166
...betrayed...our trust has been broken.

12
01:43:22,083 --> 01:43:26,375
We both know fear.

13
01:43:27,125 --> 01:43:28,875
Yet, the biggest fear we both face...

14
01:43:38,083 --> 01:43:40,583
...is the fear of ourselves.

15
01:43:48,666 --> 01:43:52,375
Let's show them we're not afraid.

16
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:57,958
Let's show them we're more
than the shackles that bind us.

17
02:18:26,708 --> 02:18:31,500
Your patience is appreciated
and I can assure you...

18
02:18:32,083 --> 02:18:35,083
...Devra is aware of your presence.

19
02:18:35,750 --> 02:18:41,583
A decision
when to receive you is imminent.

20
02:18:43,958 --> 02:18:47,750
Thank you, Levitica, honored King.

21
02:18:51,791 --> 02:18:54,000
We await their arrival.

22
02:21:26,708 --> 02:21:30,583
Darian, Devra, greetings.

23
02:30:12,541 --> 02:30:13,916
I beg you...
