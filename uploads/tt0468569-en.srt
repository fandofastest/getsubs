00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,604
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

173
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,856
Yeah? You wanna
flip a coin to see who leads?

174
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,443
My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.

175
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,780
I wouldn't leave something like that
up to chance.

176
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,200
I don't. I make my own luck.

177
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,747
Bailiff: All rise.
The honorable judge freel presiding.

178
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,583
I thought the dajust
played golf with the mayor.

179
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,462
Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Sally.

180
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,172
With carmine Falcone in arkham...

181
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,342
Someone must have stepped up
to run the so-called family.

182
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,470
Is that man in this courtroom today?

183
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,642
- Could you identify him for us, please?
- You win, counselor.

184
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,479
It was me.

185
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,022
[Crowd laughs]

186
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,984
I have a sworn statement from you
that this man...

187
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,863
Salvatore maroni, is the new head
of the Falcone crime family.

188
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,159
Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization.

189
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,369
[Crowd laughs]

190
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,936
- Judge: Order.
- Permission to treat the witness as hostile?

191
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,716
- Granted.
- Hostile? I'll show you hostile!

192
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,333
[Crowd gasps] [Gun clicks]

193
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,674
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China.

194
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:28,761
If you wanna kill a public servant,
Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy American.

195
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,306
- Judge: Get him out of here.
- But, your honor, I'm not done.

196
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,809
[Crowd chuckling and applauding]

197
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,313
We'll never be able to link the gun
to maroni, so we can't charge him.

198
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,275
But they're trying to kill you,
means we're getting to them.

199
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,570
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.
I'm fine, by the way.

200
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,447
Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's da.

201
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,450
You're not getting shot at,
you're not doing your job right.

202
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,826
But, you know...

203
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,329
If you said you were rattled,
we could take the rest of the day off.

204
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,416
Can't. I dragged the head of
the major crimes unit down here.

205
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:03,337
Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.

206
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,183
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.

207
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,605
It's a shame sal's going to walk.

208
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:24,817
Yeah, well, good thing about the mob
is they keep giving you second chances.

209
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,325
Lightly irradiated bills.

210
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,077
Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?

211
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,246
We liaise with various agencies...

212
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,165
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

213
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,919
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as Batman on sight.

214
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,254
Mm-hm. What about that floodlight
on the top of mcu?

215
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,840
If you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment...

216
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,219
I suggest you take them up
with maintenance, counselor.

217
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,055
I've put every money launderer
in Gotham behind bars...

218
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,599
But the mob
is still getting its money out.

219
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,228
I think you and your friend
have found the last game in town.

220
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,105
You're trying to hit them
where it hurts, their wallets.

221
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,526
You gonna count me in?

222
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,446
In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

223
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,865
I don't like that you got
your own special unit...

224
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,952
And it's full of cops
I investigated at internal affairs.

225
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,955
If I didn't work with cops
you'd investigated while at ia...

226
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,373
I'd be working alone.

227
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:25,628
I don't get political points for being an
idealist. I do the best I can with what I have.

228
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,969
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks...

229
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,971
Without telling me what we're after.

230
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,641
I can give you the names of the banks.

231
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,726
Well, that's a start.

232
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,437
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

233
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,441
Oh, you don't have to sell me, dent.
We all know you're Gotham's white knight.

234
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:52,154
Yeah, well, I heard they have
a different name for me down at mcu.

235
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,073
I wouldn't know about that.

236
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,995
Man: In China, lau security investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

237
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:03,457
A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne enterprises will be a powerhouse.

238
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,543
Fox: Well, Mr. Lau...

239
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,671
I speak for the rest of the board...

240
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,174
And Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

241
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,683
Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about
how his trust fund gets replenished...

242
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,352
But, frankly, this is embarrassing.

243
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,105
You worry about the diligence,
Mr. Reese.

244
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,566
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

245
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,276
It's done.

246
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,194
The numbers are solid.

247
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,904
Do them again.

248
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,158
Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out,
now, would we?

249
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,035
[Scoffs]

250
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,495
Fox: Another long night?

251
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,624
This joint venture was your idea,
and the consultants love it.

252
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,542
But I'm not convinced.

253
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,379
Lau's company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork.

254
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,965
His revenue stream
must be off the books...

255
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,550
Maybe even illegal.

256
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,385
Okay. Cancel the deal.

257
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,888
You already knew.

258
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,141
Just needed a closer look at their books.

259
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,352
Anything else you can trouble me for?

260
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,354
I need a new suit.

261
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,023
Yeah. Three buttons
is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.

262
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,318
I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox,
so much as function.

263
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,071
You wanna be able to turn your head.

264
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,323
Sure make backing out
of the driveway easier.

265
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,325
I'll see what I can do.

266
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,040
Took three weeks
to get a reservation here.

267
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,334
I had to tell them
I work for the government.

268
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,170
- Really?
- Health inspector's not afraid to pull strings.

269
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,547
Rachel. Fancy that.

270
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,217
Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.

271
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,719
Rachel, natascha. Natascha, Rachel.

272
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:44,266
- Natascha. Are you the prima...?
- Prima ballerina for the Moscow ballet.

273
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,770
- Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.
- Really? So you're into ballet?

274
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,272
Bruce. This is Harvey dent.

275
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:54,360
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

276
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,736
I certainly hope not.

277
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,407
- Let's put a couple tables together.
- I'm not sure that they'll let us.

278
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,618
Oh, they should. I own the place.

279
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,038
How could you want to raise children
in a city like this?

280
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,917
- Well, I was raised here. I turned out okay.
- Is Wayne manor in the city limits?

281
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,585
Is...? Heh-heh.

282
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,295
The palisades? Sure.

283
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:17,925
You know, as our new da, you might wanna
figure out where yourjurisdiction ends.

284
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:22,054
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

285
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,599
Gotham city is proud of an ordinary citizen
standing up for what's right.

286
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,018
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

287
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,480
- Not a man who thinks he's above the law.
- Who appointed the Batman?

288
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:35,484
We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

289
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,403
Natascha:
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

290
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,330
Dent:
When their enemies were at the gates...

291
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,200
The romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

292
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,953
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was a public service.

293
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,249
Harvey, the last man that they appointed to
protect the republic was named Caesar...

294
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,836
- And he never gave up his power.
- Okay, fine.

295
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,337
You either die a hero...

296
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,549
Or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

297
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:02,219
Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his life.

298
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,639
How could he? Batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle.

299
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,100
Natascha:
Someone like you, Mr. Dent?

300
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,020
Maybe. If I'm up to it.

301
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:16,442
What if Harvey dent
is the caped crusader? Hm?

302
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,864
If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would've noticed by now.

303
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:28,370
Well, I'm sold, dent,
and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

304
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,373
That's nice, but I'm not
up for reelection for three years.

305
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,459
No, you don't understand.

306
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,420
One fundraiser with my pals...

307
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,215
You'll never need another cent.

308
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,011
[Metal detectors
beeping and whining]

309
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,023
What the hell is this?

310
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:00,486
As you're all aware,
one of our deposits was stolen.

311
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:04,031
A relatively small amount, 68 million.

312
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,742
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?

313
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:10,621
Two-bit wackjob,
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.

314
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,748
He's not the problem. He's a nobody.

315
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:16,293
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

316
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,963
Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well-placed sources...

317
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,925
We know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills...

318
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,594
And are planning to
seize your funds today.

319
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,765
And since the enthusiastic new da has
put all my competitors out of business...

320
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,894
I'm your only option.
Maroni: So, what are you proposing?

321
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,731
Lau: Moving all deposits to
one secure location, not a bank.

322
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,859
- Where, then?
- No one can know but me.

323
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,362
If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you...

324
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,322
Everyone's money would be at stake.

325
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,616
What stop them getting to you?

326
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,870
I go to Hong Kong,
far from dent's jurisdiction...

327
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:54,123
And the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.

328

How soon can you move the money?

329
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,293
Lau: I already have.

330
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,298
For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait
for your permission.

331
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,594
Rest assured, your money is safe.

And I thought my jokes were bad.

335
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,445
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy pull your head off.

336
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:25,905
How about a magic trick?

337
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,577
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.

338
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,665
It's...

339
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,126
It's gone.

340
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,837
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

341
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,840
- You ought to know, you bought it.
- Chechen: Sit.

342
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,969
I want to hear proposition.

343
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,183
Joker:
Let's wind the clocks back a year.

344
00:23:54,516 --> 00:24:00,189
These cops and lawyers
wouldn't dare cross any of you.

345
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,484
I mean, what happened?

346
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:07,446
Did your balls drop off? Hm?

347
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,657
You see, a guy like me...

348
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,868
-A freak. Mobster 1: Damn right.

349
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:16,163
A guy like me... look, listen.

350
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:21,001
I know why you choose
to have your little, ahem...

351
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,879
Group-therapy sessions
in broad daylight.

352
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,174
I know why you're afraid
to go out at night.

353
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,053
The Batman.

354
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,475
See, Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

355
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:40,145
Dent, he's just the beginning.

356
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:45,484
And as for the television's
so-called plan...

357
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,820
Batman has no jurisdiction.

358
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,572
He'll find him and make him squeal.

359
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,742
I know the squealers when I see them...

360
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,577
And...

361
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,830
Chechen: What do you propose?

362
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,416
It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.

363
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,583
[Mobsters chuckling]

364
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,712
If it's so simple, why haven't
you done it already?

365
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,589
If you're good at something,
never do it for free.

366
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,550
How much you want?

367
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,261
Uh, half.

368
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,096
[Mobsters laughing]

369
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,224
- Gambol: You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

370
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,518
No, I'm not.

371
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:24,523
If we don't deal with this now...

372
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:31,447
Little gambol here won't be able
to get a nickel for his grandma.

373
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,574
Enough from the clown!

374
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:36,702
Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...

375
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,413
- Mobster 2: Shit!
- This out of proportion.

376
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,082
You think you can steal from us
and just walk away?

377
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,929
- Yeah.
- Gambol: I'm putting the word out.

378
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,253
Five hundred grand for this clown dead.

379
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,465
A million alive, so I can teach him
some manners first.

380
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,343
All right. So, listen,
why don't you give me a call...

381
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,264
When you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously?

382
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,308
Here's my card.

383
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,397
Mm-mm.

384
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,789
You're a hard man to reach.

385
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,086
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.

386
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,215
If you'd have asked,
I could have taken his passport.

387
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,051
All that was left in the vaults
were marked bills.

388
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:37,513
They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved...

389
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,680
My office?

390
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,559
You're sitting down there with scum like
wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...

391
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,854
Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat.

392
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:50,567
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
maroni's got people in your office, dent.

393
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,322
We need lau back...

394
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:59,451
But the Chinese won't extradite
a national under any circumstances.

395
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,496
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

396
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:03,872
I'll get him to sing.

397
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,792
We're going after the mob's life savings.

398
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,210
Things will get ugly.

399
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,671
I knew the risk when I took this job,
lieutenant.

400
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,381
How will you get him back, any...?

401
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,385
He does that.

402
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:20,055
Our Chinese friends left town
before I could tell them the deal was off.

403
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,725
Well, I'm sure that you've always wanted
to go to Hong Kong.

404
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,061
What's wrong with a phone call?

405
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:29,857
I think Mr. Lau deserves
a more personal touch.

406
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:35,863
Fox: Now, for high-altitude jumps, you're
going to need oxygen and stabilizers.

407
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:39,658
Well, I must say,
compared to your usual requests...

408
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,411
Jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightfonrvard.

409
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,164
Bruce:
What about getting back into the plane?

410
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,168
- I'd recommend a good travel agent.
- Without it landing.

411
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,088
Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

412
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,258
The CIA had a program back in the '60s...

413
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,761
For getting their people out
of hot spots called sky hook.

414
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,598
- We could look into that.
- Yeah.

415
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,433
Okay. Now...

416
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:10,939
Hardened kevlar plates over titanium-dipped
tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

417
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,942
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

418
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,615
Perhaps you should
read the instructions first?

419
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,783
- Yeah.
- Now, there is a tradeoff.

420
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,454
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

421
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,582
We wouldn't wanna make things
too easy, now, would we?

422
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,792
How will it hold up against dogs?

423
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,086
We talking rottweilers or chihuahuas?

424
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,798
Should do fine against cats.

425
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,092
I found one in Arizona.

426
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:43,430
A very nice man said he could have it up
and running in a week, and he takes cash.

427
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:46,433
- What about the flight crew?
- South Korean smugglers.

428
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,810
They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar.

429
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,730
- Did you think of an alibi?
- Oh, yes.

430
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:13,126
I believe this is your plane, sir.

431
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,842
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me?

432
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:26,014
If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

433
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,988
Yo, gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the joker.

434
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,990
Bodyguard:
They brought the body.

435
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,883
So, dead, that's 500.

436
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,637
How about alive? Hm?

437
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:12,019
You wanna know how I got these scars?

438
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,940
My father was...

439
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,567
A drinker...

440
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:19,985
And a fiend.

441
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,990
And one night,
he goes off crazier than usual.

442
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,201
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

443
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,911
He doesn't like that...

444
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,540
Not one bit.

445
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:36,251
So, me watching...

446
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:41,006
He takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.

447
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:44,259
He turns to me and he says:

448
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:48,096
"Why so serious?"

449
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,931
He comes at me with the knife.

450
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,517
"Why so serious?"

451
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,647
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

452
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:01,902
"Let's put a smile on that face."

453
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,322
And...

454
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,242
Why so serious?

455
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,210
Our operation is small...

456
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,296
But there is a lot of potential...

457
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:24,007
For aggressive expansion.

458
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:27,386
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?

459
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,973
Oh. There's only one spot open right now,
so we're gonna have...

460
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,810

461

Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

463
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,122
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today.

464
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,207
Fox: I understand.

465
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,595
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile.

466
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,347
Of course.

467
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,812
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.

468
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:22,524
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force...

469
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,235
- I couldn't let it threaten my company.
- Of course.

470
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:28,572
A businessman of your stature
will understand and...

471
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:32,701
With you here now, we can continue.

472
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:36,621
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me out
here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re...

I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.

476
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:47,674
No, I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

477
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,303
You see, we can't afford
to be seen to do business with...

478
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,389
Whatever it is you're accused of being.

479
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,142
I'm sure a businessman of your stature
will understand.

480
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:01,229
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call
might have sufficed.

481
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,774
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time.

482
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,568
Just accidentally wasting it.

483
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:11,740
That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.

485
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,095

- It's in place.

Rachel: Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

507
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,857
The money is the only reason
I'm still alive.

508
00:37:56,024 --> 00:38:00,153
Oh, you mean, when they find out that
you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?

509
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,030
- Are you threatening my client?
- No.

510
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:06,409
I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.

511
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,704
As will everyone.

512
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,375
No? Okay.

513
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,837
Enjoy your time in county, Mr. Lau.

514
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,506
Lau: Wait!

515
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,716
I won't give you the money...

516
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,886
But I will give you my clients,
all of them.

517
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,388
You were a glorified accountant.

518
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:31,392
What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge?

519
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:35,396
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all their investments.

520
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,148
One big pot.

521
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:39,859
Got it.

522
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,111
One minute.

523
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:47,575
Rico. If they pooled their money, we can
charge them as one criminal conspiracy.

524
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,910
Charge them with what?

525
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,955
In a rico case, if you can charge
one of them with a felony...

526
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,707
You can charge all of them with it.
That's great.

527
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:03,007
What kind of details do you have
about this communal fund?

528
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,801
- Ledgers...?
- Immunity, protection...

529
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:08,429
- A chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
- After you testify in open court.

530
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,932
I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up...

531
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,476
What's gonna happen
with all that money?

532
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,771
Like I said, I'm good with calculation.

533
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:21,609
He can't go to county.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

534
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,320
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

535
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,282
Well, you trust them over at county?

536
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,284
I don't trust them here.

537
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,537
Lau stays.

538
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:37,542
Well, I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel
arrangements, but I'm sure glad he's back.

539
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,169
Put word out. We hire the clown.

540

in front of my friends?

How did you convince surrillo
to hear this farce?

555
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:46,653
She shares my enthusiasm forjustice.
After all, she is a judge.

556
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,864
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of surrillo...

557
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,617
You're gonna set
a new record at appeals.

558
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,286
It won't matter.
The head guys make bail, sure.

559
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,872
But the midlevel guys, they can't.

560
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:02,168
They can't afford to be off the streets.
They'll cut deals that include some jail time.

- No, get out. Both of you.

That's the only reason that this might fly.

- All right.

671
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:09,387
- Let's be serious, then.
- Okay.

672
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,763
What's your answer?

673
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,437
I don't have an answer.

674
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,649
How'd they get my DNA?

675
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,984
Somebody with access
to your office or house...

676
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,779
Must have lifted a tissue
or a glass... wait! Wait!

677
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:29,865
- Well, I guess no answer is a no.
- Harvey.

678
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,159
- It's someone else, isn't it?
- Harvey.

679
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:35,496
Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a complete f...

680
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,456
What are you doing?

681
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:49,677
Gordon: Oh, shit.

682
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,683
[Loeb coughing]

683
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,601
Gordon: Get a medic!

684
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,148
They've come for him.

685
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,817
We made it.

686
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:08,446
Stay hidden.

687
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,030
[Shotgun blast]

688
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:14,034
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

689
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:20,875
We are tonight's entertainment.

690
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:24,044
I only have one question:

691
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:27,798
Where is Harvey dent?

692
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:39,351
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

693
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,811
Thug: Hands up, pretty boy.

694
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,855
[Thug grunting]

695
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,738
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him.

696
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:53,741
Just something little, huh? No.

697
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,787
What's going on out there? Wayne!

698
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,958
- Oh, thank god, you've got a panic room.
- Man: Hey, wait...

699
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,336
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

700
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,630
You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.

701
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:11,300
We're not intimidated by thugs.

702
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,969
You know...

703
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,599
You remind me of my father.

704
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,893
I hated my father.

705
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,103
Rachel: Okay, stop.

706
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,777
Well, hello, beautiful.

707
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:35,783
You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?

708
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,661
And you are beautiful.

709
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:49,463
You look nervous. Is it the scars?

710
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,591
You wanna know how I got them?

711
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,345
Come here. Hey.

712
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,430
Look at me.

713
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:03,644
So I had a wife.
She was beautiful, like you...

714
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:08,107
Who tells me I worry too much...

715
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:11,193
Who tells me I ought to smile more...

716
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:16,865
Who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks. Hey.

717
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:19,702
One day they carve her face.

718
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:24,456
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.

719
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:28,335
I just wanna see her smile again. Hm?

720
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:31,589
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

721
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:37,928
I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this...

722
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,763
To myself.

723
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:45,144
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.

724
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,854
She leaves.

725
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:49,982
Now I see the funny side.

726
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,443
Now I'm always smiling.

727
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,654
[Laughs]

728
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:59,199
You got a little fight in you. I like that.

729
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,701
Batman:
Then you're gonna love me.

730
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,413
[Grunting]

731
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:19,762
[Batman yells]

732
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,064
Drop the gun.

733
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:35,235
Oh, sure. You just take off your little
mask and show us all who you really are. Hm?

734
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,076
Let her go.

735
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,286
Very poor choice of words.

736
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:45,496
[Laughs]

737
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,418
[Rachel screaming]

738
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,977
Are you all right?

739
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,607
Let's not do that again.

740
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,402
- Is Harvey okay?
- He's safe.

741
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,279
Thank you.

742
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,614
Jim, it's over.

743
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,450
As long as they don't get to lau,
we've cut off their funds.

744
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,662
The prosecution's over.
Nobody's standing up in front of a judge...

745
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:30,082
While judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away.

746
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:33,293
- What about dent?
- He's got any sense, dent's halfway to mex...

747
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,045
Dent:
So where do you keep your trash?

748
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:40,342
You're due in court. I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.

749
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:43,554
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

750
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:47,057
You refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here, you go to county.

751
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,685
How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?

752
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:54,606
Targeting me won't get their money.
I knew the mob wouldn't go down easily...

753
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:58,277
- But this is different. They crossed a line.
- You crossed the line first.

754
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:01,864
You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.

755
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:07,035
And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

756
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:10,080
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

757
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,458
We just need to figure out
what he's after.

758
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,064
Alfred:
With respect, master Wayne...

759
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:17,171
Perhaps this is a man
you don't fully understand either.

760
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,674
Along time ago, I was in Burma...

761
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:24,261
And my friends and I were working
for the local government.

762
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:27,014
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

763
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:30,017
By bribing them with precious stones...

764
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:34,772
But their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of rangoon by a bandit.

765
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,233
So we went looking for the stones.

766
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:43,739
But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

767
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:48,368
One day, I saw a child
playing with a Ruby...

768
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:51,580
The size of a tangerine.

769
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,209
The bandit had been
throwing them away.

770
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:58,587
- So why steal them?
- Because he thought it was good sport.

771
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:03,717
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

772
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:08,138
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.

773
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:12,392
Some men just wanna
watch the world burn.

774
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:23,654
[Voices speaking indistinctly]

775
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:33,997
Woman: Your name, sir?

776
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,334
Joker: Eighth and orchard.
You'll find Harvey dent there.

777
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:51,682
Batman: Check the names.

778
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,982
"Richard dent."

779
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,277
"Patrick Harvey."

780
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,611
Harvey dent.

781
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,781
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

782
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,910
- It's because of you these guys are dead...
- Detective!

783
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:16,164
Give us a minute, guys.

784
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,959
That's brick underneath.

785
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:21,962
- Gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet?
- No.

786
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,133
Fingerprints.

787
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:36,602
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

788
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:43,108
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

789
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,711
I'm not sure
you made it loud enough, sir.

790
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,935
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?

791
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:21,897
You wanted me to do the diligence
on the ls! Holdings deal again.

792
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,858
Well, I found some irregularities.

793
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,361
Their ceo is in police custody.

794
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,447
No, not with their numbers, with yours.

795
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:35,577
Applied sciences. Whole division of Wayne
enterprises just disappeared overnight.

796
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:39,998
I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some old files.

797
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:46,797
Don't tell me you didn't recognize your
baby pancaking cop cars on the evening news.

798
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:50,300
Now you got the entire r & d department
burning through cash...

799
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,804
Claiming it's related to
cell phones for the army?

800
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:57,057
What are you building for him now,
a rocket ship?

801
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,686
I want...

802
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:04,773
$10 million a year
for the rest of my life.

803
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,403
Let me get this straight.

804
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,073
You think that your client...

805
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:18,078
One of the wealthiest, most powerful men
in the world, is secretly a vigilante...

806
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:22,916
Who spends his nights beating criminals
to a pulp with his bare hands...

807
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,253
And your plan
is to blackmail this person?

808
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:35,012
Good luck.

809
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:42,185
Keep that.

810
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,319
Fox: This is your original scan.

811
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:55,032
Here it is reengineered.

812
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,793
And there's the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip.

813
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:09,963
I'll get you a copy.

814
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:13,967
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign r & d?

815
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:16,636
Yeah. Government
telecommunications project.

816
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,847
Wasn't aware
we had any government contracts.

817
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:22,100
You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one
pretty close to the chest.

818
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,936
Fair enough.

819
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:30,984
Engel: With no word from the Batman,
even as they mourn commissioner loeb...

820
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:34,529
These cops have to wonder if
the joker will make good on his threat...

821
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,908
In the obituary column of
the Gotham times to kill the mayor.

822
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:43,371
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

823
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,665
Cross-reference the addresses.

824
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:49,836
Look for parkside,
overlooking the parade.

825
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:52,172
I got one.

826
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:56,343
Melvin white,
1502 Randolph apartments.

827
00:59:56,718 --> 01:00:00,806
Aggravated assault,
moved to arkham twice.

828
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,471
What do you got on the roof?

829
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:45,183
We're tight, but frankly,
there's a lot of windows up here.

830
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:57,779
Commissioner loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement...

831
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:00,240
And to the protection
of his community.

832
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,200
I remember when I first took office...

833
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,911
And I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner.

834
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:10,333
And he said he would, provided
I kept my politics out of his office.

835
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,257
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words, nor should he have been.

836
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:21,928
A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular.

837
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:25,348
Policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters...

838
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:31,396
- Who's that?
- What happened?

839
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,316
They took our guns.

840
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,276
And our uniforms.

841
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:42,699
[Ticking]

842
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:45,619
Mayor: And as we recognize the sacrifice
of this man...

843
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:49,748
We must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

844
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:52,417
Stand by. Honor guard.

845
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:56,213
Attention. Port arms.

846
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:01,801
Ready! Aim! Fire!

847
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:04,137
Ready! Aim!

848
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:05,639
[Timer dings]

849
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:10,143
Ready! Aim!

850
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,814
[Crowd screaming]

851
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,401
[Gunshots]

852
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,986
Officer: Stay down! Don't move!

853
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,490
Stephens:
Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.

854
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,960
- I'll see you later.
- Why are you going back?

855
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:45,679
[Gunshots]

856
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,430
[Crowd screaming]

857
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:48,640
Get out of here.

858
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,437
Tell me what you know about the joker.

859
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,697
[Chuckling]

860
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,709
[Engine starts]

861
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,555
I'm sorry, Barbara.

862
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,726
Jimmy, go play with your sister.
Go ahead, honey.

863
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:37,063
Stephens: If there's anything we can do,
anything you need, we're here for you.

864
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,481
[Barbara sobbing]

865
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,567
Shh.

866
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:41,985
Barbara: Are you out there?

867
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,824
Are you? You brought this
craziness on us. You did!

868
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,368
You brought this on us!

869
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:55,999
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us.

870
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:59,419
God help whoever he does wanna talk to.

871
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:00,920
[Dance music playing]

872
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:04,007
Can't we go some place quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

873
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:07,010
What makes you think
I wanna hear you talk?

874
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,219
What?

875
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,679
[Grunting]

876
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,808
[Crowd screaming]

877
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,250
-Yeah? Man: Second.

878
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,460
Okay.

879
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,796
- Harvey, where are you?
- Dent: Where are you?

880
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,800
I'm where you should be, at major crimes.
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.

881
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,553
- Can I get the fingerprint analysis?
- Rachel, listen. You're not safe there.

882
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,514
- This is Gordon's unit.
- Gordon's gone.

883
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,267
- Rachel: He vouched for these men.
- And he's gone.

884
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,982
The joker's named you next.

885
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:06,152
God, is there someone, is there anyone
in this town we can trust?

886
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,029
Bruce.

887
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,489
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

888
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:13,243
- No. Rachel, I know you're his friend, but...
- Harvey, trust me.

889
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,162
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

890
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,664
Then you go straight there.

891
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:19,958
Don't tell anybody
and I'll find you there.

892
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,835
I love you.

893
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,100
I want the joker.

894
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,978
From one professional to another...

895
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:42,689
You're trying to scare somebody,
pick a better spot.

896
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:45,442
From this height,
the fall wouldn't kill me.

897
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,193
- I'm counting on it.
- Huh!

898
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,611
[Screams]

899
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,196
[Bone cracks] [Maroni yells]

900
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:54,367
[Maroni wheezing]

901
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:57,704
- Where is he?
- I don't know where he is. He found us.

902
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,164
He must have friends.

903
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,791
Friends? Have you met this guy?

904
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,543
Someone knows where he is.

905
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,212
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

906
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,714
They're wise to your act.

907
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:11,885
You got rules.
The joker, he's got no rules.

908
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:16,931
Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.

909
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,892
But you already know what that is.

910
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:21,853
Just take off that mask,
let him come find you.

911
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,271
[Growls]

912
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:27,567
Or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind.

913
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,237
You wanna play games?

914
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:34,866
[Gunshot]

915
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:38,578
How's that feel?

916
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:41,372
- You wouldn't.
- I wouldn't!

917
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:44,501
- You don't think I will?
- Mm-mm.

918
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,711
- You don't think I will?
- Mm-mm.

919
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:51,299
No. No, I wouldn't.

920
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:55,053
That's why I'm not
gonna leave it up to me.

921
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:59,057
Heads, you get to keep your head.

922
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:01,100
Tails...

923
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,102
Not so lucky.

924
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:07,023
So you wanna tell me about the joker?

925
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:11,444
[Thug chuckles]

926
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:20,119
- Let's go again.
- I don't know anything! God, don't!

927
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,664
You're not playing the odds, friend.

928
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,792
Let's do it again.

929
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:30,463
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

930
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:34,801
- Not exactly.
- His name's schiff, Thomas.

931
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:37,971
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at arkham.

932
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:42,767
The kind of mind the joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?

933
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:48,898
The joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.

934
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,859
You're the symbol of hope
I could never be.

935
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,861
Your stand against organized crime...

936
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:57,240
Is the first legitimate ray of light
in Gotham in decades.

937
01:07:57,407 --> 01:08:01,035
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

938
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,496
The criminals you arrested
would be released...

939
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:06,749
And Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.

940
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,627
You're gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow.

941
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,171
- —Why?
- No one else will die because of me.

942
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,674
Gotham's in your hands now.

943
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:16,551
You can't.

944
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:18,094
You can't give in.

945
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:20,930
You can't give in!

946
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:37,530
Harvey called.

947
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:40,742
He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.

948
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,035
I have no choice.

949
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:45,288
You honestly think that's gonna
keep the joker from killing people?

950
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:48,916
Maybe not. But I have enough blood
on my hands.

951
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:54,213
And I've seen now what I would
have to become to stop men like him.

952
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:58,217
You once told me that
if the day came when I was finished...

953
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,470
That we'd be together.

954
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:04,349
Bruce, don't make me
your one hope for a normal life.

955
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,226
Did you mean it?

956
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,624
Bruce.

957
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:34,504
If you turn yourself in,
they're not gonna let us be together.

958
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:48,101
Alfred: Logs as well?
Bruce: Everything.

959
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:51,646
Anything that could lead back
to Lucius or Rachel.

960
01:09:56,984 --> 01:10:00,279
People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?

961
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:04,200
Endure, master Wayne. Take it.

962
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:08,079
They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

963
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:13,793
He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one else can make.

964
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,294
The right choice.

965
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:18,840
No, today I found out
what Batman can't do.

966
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,258
He can't endure this.

967
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:23,428
Today you get to say "I told you so."

968
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:27,181
Today, I don't want to.

969
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,480
But I did bloody tell you.

970
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:35,982
[Bruce chuckles]

971
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:40,528
Alfred: I suppose they're gonna
lock me up as well...

972
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,572
As your accomplice.

973
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:47,493
Bruce: Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

974
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:55,293
Ladies and gentlemen, I've called
this press conference for two reasons.

975
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,503
Firstly, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...

976
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:01,340
That everything that can be done
over the joker killings is being done.

977
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:02,550
[Chattering]

978
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:05,803
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

979
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,680
But let's consider the situation.

980
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:10,683
Should we give in
to this terrorist's demands?

981
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,310
Do we really think he's gonna...?

982
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:15,855
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens?

983
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:18,399
The Batman is an outlaw.

984
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:23,029
That's not why we demand he turn himself
in, we're doing it because we're scared.

985
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:25,990
We've been happy to let Batman
clean up our streets till now.

986
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:29,118
Man 1: Things are worse than ever!
Man 2: Amen.

987
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,371
Yes, they are.

988
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:37,877
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

989
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:42,423
And I promise you...

990
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:44,634
The dawn is coming.

991
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:49,347
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...

992
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:51,265
Not to this madman.

993
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,768
- No more dead cops!
- Officers: Yeah!

994
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:58,648
He should turn himself in!

995
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:01,526
Man 3: Give us the Batman! Come on!
Man 4: Where is he?

996
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,572
So be it. Take the Batman into custody.

997
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:08,991
Woman: What? Man 5: Is he here?

998
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:10,743
I am the Batman.

999
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:14,080
Man 6: What? Man 7: Come on.

1000
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:24,382
Rachel: Alfred.

1001
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,510
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

1002
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:30,680
- He went down to the press conference.
- I know. He just stood by.

1003
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,932
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...

1004
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:36,102
Believe that Batman stands for
something more important...

1005
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:38,604
Than the whims of a terrorist,
miss dawes...

1006
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,773
Even if everyone hates him for it.

1007
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,067
That's the sacrifice he's making.

1008
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:46,863
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.

1009
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:49,031
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

1010
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,285
Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.

1011
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,581

01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:04,123
He says he's waited as long as he can
for Batman to do the right thing.

1354
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:06,375
Now he's taking matters
into his own hands.

1355
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:09,504
We 'ii be live at 5 with
the true identity of the Batman.

1356
01:40:25,937 --> 01:40:27,563
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1357
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:35,112
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but that you won't accept medication.

1358
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:38,115
That you're refusing to...

1359
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:40,034
Accept skin grafts.

1360
01:40:40,368 --> 01:40:42,620
Remember that name...

1361
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:45,540
You all had for me...

1362
01:40:45,998 --> 01:40:48,834
When I was at internal affairs?

1363
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:52,588
What was it, Gordon?

1364
01:40:53,256 --> 01:40:54,632
Harvey, I...

1365
01:40:54,799 --> 01:40:56,300
Say it.

1366
01:40:57,718 --> 01:40:59,637
Say it!

1367
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:10,398
Two-face. Harvey two-face.

1368
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:16,279
Why should I hide who I am?

1369
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:18,823
I know you tried to warn me.

1370
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:20,908
I'm sorry.

1371
01:41:21,534 --> 01:41:24,161
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1372
01:41:26,455 --> 01:41:28,833
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1373
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:32,670
Harvey, I need to know
which of my men I can trust.

1374
01:41:33,045 --> 01:41:35,172
Why would you listen to me now?

1375
01:41:36,299 --> 01:41:37,967
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1376
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:44,890
No, you're not.

1377
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:47,184
Not yet.

1378
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:55,151
This craziness, it's too much.

1379
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,613
Should've thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.

1380
01:41:58,779 --> 01:42:00,531
Maroni: You want him?

1381
01:42:02,992 --> 01:42:05,369
I can tell you
where he'll be this afternoon.

1382
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:15,671
Chechen:
Not so crazy as you look.

1383
01:42:15,838 --> 01:42:19,592
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

1384
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:24,055
Where is the Italian?

1385
01:42:24,221 --> 01:42:27,350
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.

1386
01:42:27,516 --> 01:42:30,978
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

1387
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:32,730
Chechen: Please.

1388
01:42:32,897 --> 01:42:36,233
Joker-man, what you do
with all your money?

1389
01:42:36,901 --> 01:42:39,570
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.

1390
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:41,405
I enjoy...

1391
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:42,948
Dynamite...

1392
01:42:43,115 --> 01:42:44,659
And gunpowder...

1393
01:42:45,117 --> 01:42:47,536
And gasoline.

1394
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:51,248
- What the...?
- Ah, ah, ah.

1395
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:55,920
And you know the thing
that they have in common?

1396
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:57,713
They're cheap.

1397
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,560
Caller 1 [on TV]: How much are they
paying you to say who Batman is?

1398
01:43:00,716 --> 01:43:04,679
This is our chance. I want lau alive.
The joker, either way.

1399
01:43:04,845 --> 01:43:06,263
Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.

1400
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:07,765
Engel:
Let's take the next caller.

1401
01:43:07,932 --> 01:43:10,213
Caller 2: Harvey dent didn't wanna
give in to this maniac.

1402
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:11,560
You think you know better?

1403
01:43:11,727 --> 01:43:15,106
I think that if we could talk to
dent today, he may feel differently.

1404
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:19,360
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
Because god knows, we need him now.

1405
01:43:19,527 --> 01:43:21,737
You said you were a man of your word.

1406
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:24,073
Oh, I am.

1407
01:43:25,783 --> 01:43:28,452
I'm only burning my half.

1408
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:31,914
All you care about is money.

1409
01:43:32,081 --> 01:43:35,543
This town deserves
a better class of criminal...

1410
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:37,962
And I'm gonna give it to them.

1411
01:43:38,754 --> 01:43:41,257
Tell your men they work for me now.

1412
01:43:41,424 --> 01:43:43,801
This is my city.

1413
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:47,012
They won't work for a freak.

1414
01:43:47,179 --> 01:43:48,889
[Imitates chechen] "Freak."

1415
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:51,536
[In normal voice] Why don't
we cut you up into little pieces...

1416
01:43:51,684 --> 01:43:53,144
And feed you to your pooches? Hm?

1417
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:56,188
And then we'll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is.

1418
01:43:56,355 --> 01:43:57,773
[Dogs barking]

1419
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:00,526
It's not about money...

1420
01:44:00,693 --> 01:44:03,904
It's about sending a message.

1421
01:44:04,697 --> 01:44:07,158
Everything burns.

1422
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,829
- Who is this?
- Joker: [Had a vision...

1423
01:44:11,996 --> 01:44:14,749
Of a world without Batman.

1424
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:17,168
The mob ground out a little profit...

1425
01:44:17,334 --> 01:44:21,255
And the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.

1426
01:44:21,422 --> 01:44:24,717
And it was so boring.

1427
01:44:24,884 --> 01:44:26,844
I've had a change of heart.

1428
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:29,638
I don't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything...

1429
01:44:29,805 --> 01:44:34,518
But why should I have all the fun?
Let's give someone else a chance.

1430
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:39,523
If Coleman Reese
isn't dead in 60 minutes...

1431
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:41,776
Then I blow up a hospital.

1432
01:44:41,942 --> 01:44:43,527
Call in every officer.

1433
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:47,031
Tell them to head to their nearest hospital
and start evac and search.

1434
01:44:47,198 --> 01:44:51,118
Call the transit authority, school board,
prisons. Get every bus down to a hospital.

1435
01:44:51,285 --> 01:44:55,873
The priority is Gotham general. Wheel
everybody out of that place right now.

1436
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,708
You, you and you, you come with me.

1437
01:44:57,875 --> 01:44:59,794
- Where are we going, sir?
- To get Reese.

1438
01:45:00,044 --> 01:45:03,172
I need you plugged in,
checking Gordon's men and their families.

1439
01:45:03,339 --> 01:45:05,549
- Looking for?
- Hospital admissions.

1440
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:07,384
Will you be wanting the batpod?

1441
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:09,512
In the middle of the day?
Not very subtle.

1442
01:45:09,678 --> 01:45:10,971
The lamborghini, then.

1443
01:45:11,889 --> 01:45:13,015
Much more subtle.

1444
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:24,527
[Crowd shouting]

1445
01:45:26,862 --> 01:45:29,365
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me. Okay.

1446
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:33,035
Sir, could you help, please?

1447
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:34,912
I'm gonna find a bus for him.

1448

Engel:
Sir? Commissioner, do you really think...

1449
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:41,085
An ordinary citizen
would try to kill this man?

1450
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:47,925
Engel: Sir. Commissioner.

1451
01:45:48,092 --> 01:45:49,677
[Crowd screaming]

1452
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:52,221
Get the cars around the back!

Go. Keep rolling, Sam.

1454
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:03,858
I see o'brien and Richards.

1455
01:46:04,441 --> 01:46:07,945
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.

- Well, maybe Batman can save you.

01:46:37,141 --> 01:46:39,476

Alfred: Nothing on them.

1461
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:42,479
And a patrolman I don't know.

01:46:43,689 --> 01:46:45,608
Reese: Okay, so, what now?

1463
01:46:46,483 --> 01:46:48,736
What do we do now?
Where are we going?

1464
01:46:51,488 --> 01:46:53,157
Send the information to Gordon.

Ma'am, we're gonna have to
move him now.

- Commissioner.

You know...

1474
01:47:55,386 --> 01:47:58,472
I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1475
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:01,767
- When you and...
- Rachel!

I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1478
01:48:07,731 --> 01:48:09,650
I didn't rig those charges.

1479
01:48:09,858 --> 01:48:12,319
Your men, your plan.

1480
01:48:12,528 --> 01:48:14,989
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.

1482
01:48:18,826 --> 01:48:21,286
I wouldn't know what to do with one
if I caught it.

1483
01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:24,581
You know? I just do things.

1484
01:48:24,957 --> 01:48:28,669
The mob has plans. The cops have plans.

1485
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:31,046
Gordon's got plans.

1486
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:34,174
You know, they're schemers.

1487
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:38,095
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.

1488
01:48:38,262 --> 01:48:39,763
I'm not a schemer.

1489
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:41,557
I try to show the schemers...

1490
01:48:41,724 --> 01:48:47,021
How pathetic their attempts
to control things really are.

1491
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:51,025
So when I say... ah. Come here.

1492

When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal...

1493

You'll know that I'm telling the truth.

- I'm gonna need your weapon.
- What?

1495
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:09,710
Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?

Yeah, that'd be why.

that put you where you are.

and I turned it on itself.

a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets.

things go "according to plan."

Even if the plan is horrifying.

a gangbanger will get shot...

will be blowing up...

Nobody panics.

1511

But when I say that
one little old mayor will die...

1513

Well, then, everyone loses their minds.

1514

Introduce a little anarchy...

1515

Upset the established order...

1516
01:50:30,999 --> 01:50:35,546
And everything becomes chaos.

1517
01:50:37,381 --> 01:50:40,134
I'm an agent of chaos.

aboutchaos?

- You live.
- Mm-hm.

1521
01:50:59,403 --> 01:51:01,029
You die.

1522
01:51:01,238 --> 01:51:03,240

02:15:59,109 --> 02:16:01,862
- Trying to save her.
- But you didn't.

1858
02:16:02,154 --> 02:16:05,574
- I couldn't.
- Yes, you could've. If you'd listened to me.

1859
02:16:05,741 --> 02:16:08,369
If you stood up against corruption...

1860
02:16:08,535 --> 02:16:10,746
Instead of doing your deal
with the devil.

1861
02:16:10,913 --> 02:16:12,539
I was trying to fight the mob!

1862
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:17,878
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what I'd lost.

1863
02:16:19,171 --> 02:16:22,299
Have you ever had to talk to the person
you loved most...

1864
02:16:22,466 --> 02:16:26,345
Tell them it's gonna be all right,
when you know it's not?

1865
02:16:28,013 --> 02:16:31,892
Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.

1866
02:16:32,643 --> 02:16:36,522
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1867
02:16:38,273 --> 02:16:41,860
- You're not going to hurt my family.
- No.

1868
02:16:42,027 --> 02:16:44,738
Just the person you love most.

1869
02:16:51,537 --> 02:16:52,579
[Gun cocks]

1870
02:16:52,746 --> 02:16:55,791
So is it your wife?

1871
02:16:56,875 --> 02:16:58,544
Put the gun down, Harvey.

1872
02:16:58,919 --> 02:17:00,587
Harvey, put down the gun.

1873
02:17:00,754 --> 02:17:04,299
Please. Please, Harvey. Please.

1874
02:17:05,676 --> 02:17:06,969
Oh, goddamn it.

1875
02:17:07,136 --> 02:17:09,304
Will you stop pointing that gun
at my family?

1876
02:17:09,805 --> 02:17:11,473
- Barbara: No!
- We have a winner.

1877
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:13,142
No, Jim, stop him!

1878
02:17:13,642 --> 02:17:15,477
Gordon: Harvey.
Barbara: Don't let him...

1879
02:17:15,644 --> 02:17:16,770
Harvey!

1880
02:17:16,937 --> 02:17:17,980
[Barbara sobbing]

1881
02:17:18,147 --> 02:17:20,023
I'm sorry!

1882
02:17:21,817 --> 02:17:22,901
For everything.

1883
02:17:25,487 --> 02:17:27,698
Please don't hurt my son.

1884
02:17:29,658 --> 02:17:31,368
[Dogs barking]

1885
02:17:31,535 --> 02:17:33,495
[Chattering]

1886
02:17:37,833 --> 02:17:39,418
You brought your cops?

1887
02:17:39,585 --> 02:17:42,463
All they know is there's a situation.

1888
02:17:42,629 --> 02:17:45,632
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1889
02:17:45,799 --> 02:17:48,469
You think I wanna escape from this?

1890
02:17:48,635 --> 02:17:51,388
There is no escape from this.

1891
02:17:51,555 --> 02:17:53,682
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1892
02:17:55,976 --> 02:17:59,188
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1893
02:17:59,938 --> 02:18:04,151
You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time.

1894
02:18:06,945 --> 02:18:08,030
But you were wrong.

1895
02:18:08,739 --> 02:18:12,534
The world is cruel. And the only morality
in a cruel world...

1896
02:18:13,285 --> 02:18:15,204
Is chance.

1897
02:18:17,289 --> 02:18:18,540
Unprejudiced.

1898
02:18:19,917 --> 02:18:21,043
Fair.

1899
02:18:21,210 --> 02:18:23,462
His son's got the same chance she had.

1900
02:18:24,213 --> 02:18:25,506
Fifty-fifty.

1901
02:18:25,672 --> 02:18:29,134
What happened to Rachel wasn't chance.
We decided to act.

1902
02:18:30,969 --> 02:18:34,389
Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything?

1903
02:18:36,892 --> 02:18:39,520
- It wasn't.
- The joker chose me.

1904
02:18:39,686 --> 02:18:41,980
Because you were the best of us.

1905
02:18:42,147 --> 02:18:47,152
He wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you...

1906
02:18:47,319 --> 02:18:49,071
Could fall.

1907
02:18:49,404 --> 02:18:50,697
And he was right.

1908
02:18:50,864 --> 02:18:53,116
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1909
02:18:53,283 --> 02:18:56,328
So point it at the people responsible.

1910
02:18:57,287 --> 02:18:59,122
Fair enough.

1911
02:19:02,459 --> 02:19:04,336
You first.

1912
02:19:16,849 --> 02:19:18,517
My turn.

1913
02:19:25,440 --> 02:19:27,442
Harvey, you're right.

1914
02:19:28,485 --> 02:19:31,113
Rachel's death was my fault.

1915
02:19:34,199 --> 02:19:36,660
Please don't punish the boy.

1916
02:19:37,744 --> 02:19:40,956
- Please, punish me.
- I'm about to.

1917
02:19:42,916 --> 02:19:44,877
Tell your boy
he's gonna be all right, Gordon.

1918
02:19:45,335 --> 02:19:46,962
Lie...

1919
02:19:52,342 --> 02:19:53,927
It's going to be all right, son.

1922
02:20:32,341 --> 02:20:35,177
Dad? Daddy, is he okay?

[Batman panting]

1924
02:20:51,693 --> 02:20:53,862
- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

1925
02:20:54,488 --> 02:20:56,281
Yes, I do.

1926
02:21:00,535 --> 02:21:01,870
The joker won.

1927
02:21:04,289 --> 02:21:07,167
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

1928
02:21:07,709 --> 02:21:09,461
."Undone.

1929
02:21:09,962 --> 02:21:14,883
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

1930
02:21:17,552 --> 02:21:20,430
The joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

1931
02:21:21,014 --> 02:21:22,432
People will lose hope.

1932
02:21:22,599 --> 02:21:24,351
They won't.

1933
02:21:26,853 --> 02:21:28,730
They must never know what he did.

1934
02:21:28,897 --> 02:21:30,732
Five dead.

1935
02:21:31,024 --> 02:21:34,945
- Two of them cops. You can't sweep that...
- No.

1936
02:21:39,741 --> 02:21:42,577
But the joker cannot win.

1937
02:21:47,833 --> 02:21:51,044
Gotham needs its true hero.

1938
02:21:57,426 --> 02:22:00,470
- No.
- You either die a hero...

1939
02:22:00,637 --> 02:22:05,100
Or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

1940
02:22:05,267 --> 02:22:07,102
I can do those things...

1941
02:22:07,519 --> 02:22:10,564
Because I'm not a hero, not like dent.

1942
02:22:13,567 --> 02:22:16,445
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

1943
02:22:16,611 --> 02:22:18,530
No, no, you can't. You're not.

1944
02:22:18,697 --> 02:22:21,283
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1945
02:22:22,951 --> 02:22:24,077
Call it in.

1946
02:22:27,372 --> 02:22:29,124
Gordon: Ahem.

1947
02:22:29,291 --> 02:22:32,544
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1948
02:22:33,128 --> 02:22:35,672
Nothing less than a knight...

Batman: You'll hunt me.

1952
02:22:42,637 --> 02:22:44,598
You'll condemn me.

1953
02:22:45,307 --> 02:22:47,601
Set the dogs on me.

1954
02:22:51,354 --> 02:22:53,648
Because that's what needs to happen.

1955
02:22:54,816 --> 02:22:56,735
Because sometimes...

1956
02:22:56,902 --> 02:22:59,071
The truth isn't good enough.

1957
02:22:59,946 --> 02:23:02,240
Sometimes people deserve more.

1958
02:23:05,702 --> 02:23:09,623
Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.

Batman!

1962
02:23:34,147 --> 02:23:36,108
Why's he running, dad?

1963
02:23:37,150 --> 02:23:38,485
Because we have to chase him.

1964
02:23:38,652 --> 02:23:41,530
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

1965
02:23:47,619 --> 02:23:49,204
He didn't do anything wrong.

[Barking]

1967
02:23:51,957 --> 02:23:57,546
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1968
02:23:58,964 --> 02:24:00,006
So we'll hunt him...

1969
02:24:03,135 --> 02:24:05,220
Because he can take it.

1970
02:24:07,722 --> 02:24:10,225
Because he's not a hero.

1971
02:24:17,774 --> 02:24:18,984
He's a silent guardian...

1972
02:24:20,152 --> 02:24:22,028
A watchful protector.

1973
02:24:24,531 --> 02:24:25,824
